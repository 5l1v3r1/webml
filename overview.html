<h2>Tor: Overview</h2>

<p>
Tor is a network-within-a-network that allows people and groups to
improve their privacy and security on the Internet.  It also enables
future software developers to create new kinds of communication tools
that have built-in privacy features.  Tor can provide the foundation for
a whole range of applications that allow organizations and individuals
to share information over public networks without compromising their
privacy.
</p>

<p>
Individuals can use Tor to shield themselves and their family members
from being tracked by remote websites.  They can also use it to connect
to resources such as news sites or instant messaging services that are
blocked by their local Internet service providers (ISPs).
</p>

<p>
Groups such as the German "Diabetes People" organization recommend Tor
for safeguarding their members' online privacy and security.  Activist
groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are supporting
Tor's development as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online.
Corporations are investigating Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive
analysis, and are considering using Tor to test new experimental projects
without associating their names with these projects. A branch of the
US Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and one of its
teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently.
</p>

<p>
The variety of people who use Tor is actually part of what makes it
so secure.  The more populous and diverse the user base for Tor is,
the more your anonymity will be protected.
</p>

<h3>Why We Need Tor</h3>

<p>
Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance
known as "traffic analysis."  Traffic analysis can be used to infer
who is talking to whom over a public network.  Knowing the source
and destination of your Internet traffic allows others to track your
behavior and interests.  This can impact your checkbook if, for example,
an e-commerce site uses price discrimination based on your country or
institution of origin.  It can even threaten your job and physical safety
by revealing who and where you are.
</p>

<p>
How does traffic analysis work?  Internet data packets have two parts:
a data payload, and a header used for routing.  The data payload is
whatever is being sent, whether that's an email message, a web page, or an
audio file.  Even if you encrypt the data payload of your communications,
traffic analysis still reveals a great deal about what you're doing and,
possibly, what you're saying.  That's because it focuses on the header,
which discloses source, destination, size, timing, and so on.
</p>

<p>
A basic problem, for the privacy minded, is that the recipient of your
communications can see who sent them by looking at headers.  So can
authorized intermediaries like Internet service providers, and sometimes
unauthorized intermediaries as well.  A very simple form of traffic
analysis might involve sitting somewhere between sender and recipient on
the network, looking at headers.
</p>

<p>
But there are also more powerful kinds of traffic analysis.  Some
attackers spy on multiple parts of the Internet and use sophisticated
statistical techniques to track the communications patterns of many
different organizations and individuals.
</p>

<h3>The Solution: a Distributed, Anonymous Network</h3>

<p>
Tor helps to reduce the risks of both simple and sophisticated traffic
analysis by distributing your transactions over several places on the
Internet, so no single point can link you to your destination.  The idea
is similar to using a twisty, hard-to-follow route in order to throw off
somebody who is tailing you -- and then periodically erasing your
footprints.  Instead of taking a direct route from source to
destination, data packets on the Tor network take a random pathway
through several servers that cover your tracks so no observer at any
single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.
</p>

<p>
To create a private network pathway with Tor, the user's software or
client incrementally builds a circuit of encrypted connections through
servers on the network.  The circuit is extended one hop at a time, and
each server along the way knows only which server gave it data and which
server it is giving data to.  No individual server will ever know the
complete path that a data packet has taken.  The client negotiates a
separate set of encryption keys for each hop along the circuit to ensure
that each hop can't see what these connections are as they pass through.
</p>

<p>
[Insert snazzy onion diagram here.]
</p>

<p>
Once a circuit has been established, many kinds of data can be exchanged
and several different sorts of software applications can be deployed
over the Tor network.  Because each server sees no more than one hop in
the circuit, neither an eavesdropper nor a compromised server can use
traffic analysis to link the connection's source and destination.  Tor
only works for TCP streams and can be used by any application with SOCKS
support.
</p>

<p>
For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections
that happen within the same minute or so.  Later requests are given a
new circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new
ones.
</p>

<h3>Hidden Services</h3>

<p>
Tor also makes it possible for users to hide their locations while
offering various kinds of services, such as web publishing or an instant
messaging server.  Using Tor "rendezvous points," other Tor users can
connect to these hidden services, each without knowing the other's
network identity.  This hidden service functionality could allow Tor
users to set up a website where people publish material without worrying
about censorship.  Nobody would be able to determine who was offering
the site, and nobody who offered the site would know who was posting to it.
</p>

<h3>Staying Anonymous</h3>

<p>
Of course, Tor can't solve all anonymity problems.  It focuses only on
protecting the transport of data.  You need to use protocol-specific
support software if you don't want the sites you visit to see your
identifying information.  For example, web proxies such as Privoxy can
be used while web browsing to block cookies and withhold information
about your browser type.
</p>

<p>
Also, to protect your anonymity, be smart.  Don't provide your name
or other revealing information in web forms.  Be aware that like all
anonymizing networks that are fast enough for web browsing, Tor does not
provide protection against end-to-end timing attacks: if your attacker
can watch the traffic coming out of your computer, and also the traffic
arriving at your chosen destination, he can use statistical analysis to
discover that they are part of the same circuit.
</p>

<h3>The Future of Tor</h3>

<p>
Providing a usable anonymizing network on the Internet today is
an ongoing challenge. We want software that meets users' needs.
And we also want to keep the network up and running in a way that
handles as many users as possible. Security and usability don't have
to be at odds: as Tor's usability increases, it will attract more
users, which will increase the possible sources and destinations
of each communication, thus increasing security for everyone.
We're making progress, but we need your help.  Please consider

</p>

<p>
Anonymity is threatened as never before by trends in law, policy, and
technology that are undermining our ability to speak and read freely
online without being forced to reveal who we are.  With each new user
and server, we enhance Tor's ability to restore people's control over
their privacy.
