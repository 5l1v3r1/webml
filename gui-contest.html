<h2>Tor GUI Contest</h2>
<hr />
<p>DRAFT IN PROGRESS -- ALL OF THIS STUFF IS IN FLUX AND SHOULD BE
CONSIDERED WRONG.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Tor is a decentralized network of computers on the Internet that increases
privacy in Web browsing, instant messaging, and other applications. We
estimate there are some 50,000 Tor users currently, routing their traffic
through about 250 volunteer Tor servers on five continents. However, Tor's
current user interface approach --- running as a daemon in the background
--- does a poor job of communicating network status and security levels
to the user.
</p>

<p>
The Tor project, affiliated with the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, is
running a UI contest to develop a vision of how Tor can
work in a user's everyday anonymous browsing experience. Some of the
challenges include how to make alerts and error conditions visible on
screen; how to let the user configure Tor to use or avoid certain routes
or nodes; how to learn about the current state of a Tor connection,
including which servers it uses; and how to find out whether (and which)
applications are using Tor safely.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Contestants will produce a work of <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
that will
provide a user interface to the Tor system by way of the <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/control-spec.txt">Tor Controller
Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking for a vision of how Tor can work in a user's everyday
anonymous browsing experience.</p>

<p>Successful entries will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to fully configure Tor without directly searching
for and opening text files.</li>
<li>Learn about the current state of their Tor connection (including
which servers they are connected to, and how many of them), and find
out whether any of their applications are using it.</li>
<li>Make alerts and error conditions visible on screen.</li>
<li>Run on at least one of Windows, Linux, and OS X, on a
not-unusually-configured consumer-level machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide detailed information about which
applications, ports, or packets are (or are not!) passing through Tor,
including accounting for both Tor- and non-Tor traffic</li>
<li>Provide
additional statistics about the Tor connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much bandwidth am I using?</li>
<li>What servers do I know about on the network? Where are they? How
available are they?</li>
<li>Provide an interface for controlling Tor paths: "show me
the network from Africa by way of Asia". Think of the global satellite
map from the movie <i>Sneakers</i>.</li>
<li>Configure other running applications to use Tor (for example,
by modifying or working through the network stack, and/or by altering
application configurations).</li>
<li>Provide an elegant installer for Tor, the GUI application, and
other supporting applications.</li>
<li>Provide meaningful defaults for a good Tor experience.</li>
<li>Provide application-level anonymity -- that is, not just paying
attention to transport anonymity on the level of Tor, but also paying
attention to the anonymity of the http headers, cookies, etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Contest categories</h3>

<p>
The design contest will proceed in two stages: first sketches and
then code. For each stage, our panel of judges will recognize the best
submissions. All qualifying entries will receive an EFF Tor t-shirt,
subject to availability. The best functional implementations will be
published on the Tor website.
</p>

<p><b>Sketches:</b>
the goal of this stage is to produce a mock-up of a functioning interface,
with graphical elements that can be used by programmers and design
documents describing how the interface should function.</p>

<p>
A qualifying sketch will present an informal specification for a
design. That is, it will present with some degree of thoroughness all
of the major interfaces that we might expect to encounter, all of the
major functionality for the interface, and a reasonable story about
how it would be integrated into currently-existing tools (if, indeed,
it would be). An example, with more detail than we would require, is
<a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/docs/ui/junits/promo_f.html">the NetBeans
UI for JUnit</a>. Note that it walks through multiple interfaces,
highlighting the features and functions of the various buttons.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Most featureful interface</b> will be awarded to the graphic design
that would provide usable, clear access to the most aspects of the Tor
system, covering many or most of the categories on the "additional"
list.</li>
<li><b>Most usable experience</b> will be awarded to the graphic
design that would provide the most unobtrusive Tor experience while still
covering all criteria (working, perhaps, on the "no news is good news"
theory).</li>
<li><b>Clearest implementation guidance</b> will be awarded to the
graphic design that provides the cleanest package of graphic elements
and design documentation to aid would-be implementers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Code:</b> the goal of this stage is to produce a working
implementation. You may use any of the sketches, graphics, or ideas from
the first stage.</p>

<p>
An acceptable entry will be a package of free software that builds and
runs. It can be a standalone application, or it can act as an extension
or plugin to other broadly-available free software. The entry will
demonstrate the points in the judging section: that is, it will be able
to control, display, and maintain awareness as discussed above.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Most featureful interface</b> will be awarded to the application
that provides usable, clear access to the most aspects of the Tor system,
covering many or most of the categories on the "additional" list.</li>
<li><b>Most usable experience</b> will be awarded to the
application that provides the most unobtrusive Tor experience while
still covering all criteria (working, perhaps, on the "no news is good
news" theory).</li>
<li><b>Most flexible</b> will be awarded to the best system that runs
smoothly on all three of Windows, Linux, and OS X; extra points will be
awarded for additional systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to award other awards as the entries deserve.</p>

<hr />
<h3>How to Submit</h3>

<p>Submissions for phase one (sketches) should come as:</p>
<ul>
<li>foo<li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions for phase two (code) should come as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code, with appropriate makefiles or documentation explaining

FAQ entry</a> for clarification.</li>
<li>Compiled binaries or bytecodes for at least one platform of choice.</li>
<li>A design document providing an overview of what major functions
to look for and what functions were implemented.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Criteria</h3>

<p>Awards will be granted on the basis of (in rough preference order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Usability (<a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/ContestFAQ#DefineUsable">what
does this mean?</a>)</li>
<li>Informativeness: can the user learn what they need to know, both in terms
of using the network and also in terms of security decisions?</li>
<li>Total user experience</li>
<li>Aesthetics</li>
<li>Responsiveness</li>
<li>Stability and robustness</li>
<li>Internationalization (multiple language support)</li>
<li>Installation experience</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Judges</h3>

<p>Judging will be led by a panel of N prominent specialists in usability
and security (to be announced).</p>

<hr />
<h3>Timeline</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 deadline (sketches): October 31.</li>
<li>Stage 1 judging: November 31.</li>
<li>Stage 2 deadline (code): January 31, 2006.</li>

<p>Winners will be announced at the SOUPS 2006 conference.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Questions and clarifications</h3>

<p>We will have a public website and wiki up shortly for FAQ entries,
clarifications, etc.</p>





<hr />
<hr />
<h3>Testing criteria</h3>

<p>To check for basic acceptability, the contest will be judged
with several major tests. For example, the system designer should expect:</p>

<ul>
<li>A minimal test: does it work?</li>
<li>Several parameters, both obscure and obvious, will be configured. Is
it possible and easy to do so?</li>
<li>A network will be connected once the system is running. Can the
user tell that the network is now live?</li>
<li>The network will be disconnected or interrupted. Can the user tell
that the network has an error?</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>Submissions</h3>

<hr />
<h3>Technical Notes</h3>

<p>Shortly before phase two begins, the Tor developers will release
a canonical code version. This is the version that will be used for
judging the contest; please ensure that you use this version. Bugfixes
to this version will be announced to the contest web site.</p>

<p>The Tor developers will also release test rigs (libraries) in both Java
and Python that demonstrate Tor's controller protocol. Code submissions
may be able to save a lot of time by using this code as a skeleton.</p>
