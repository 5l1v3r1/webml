"The Tor Project encourages developers to use the name Tor in ways that do "
"not confuse the public about the source of anonymity software and services.  "
"If you are building open-source non-commercial software or services that "
"incorporate or work with The Tor Project's code, you may use the name “Tor” "
"in an accurate description of your work.  We ask you to include a link to "
"the official Tor website <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">https://www."
"torproject.org/</a> so users can verify the original source of Tor for "
"themselves, and a note indicating that your project is not sponsored by The "
"Tor Project. For example, “This product is produced independently from the "
"Tor&#174; anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project "
"about quality, suitability or anything else.”"

"that look like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point (e.g. an exploded "
"onion with layers, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in "
"ways that would confuse people."

"The Tor Project is a non-profit corporation organized to research and "
"develop the Tor anonymity software and network.  We don't want to be "
"trademark bullies, but we will use trademark to protect the public's ability "
"to recognize Tor Project software.  Trademark law helps us to assure that "
"the name is used only in connection with genuine Tor anonymity software and "
"for accurate description of software and services.  After all, to protect "
"their anonymity securely, computer users must be able to identify the "
"software they are using, so they can account properly for its strengths and "
"weaknesses.  Tor has become well-known as a software package and associated "
"network of onion-routing anonymizing proxies, with online documentation, "
"instructions for strengthening anonymity protection, and warnings that even "
"at this stage it remains experimental software.  We work with developers to "
"improve the software and network and actively encourage researchers to "
"document attacks to help us strengthen its anonymity protection further.  We "
"distribute the software itself freely, but require correct attribution."
