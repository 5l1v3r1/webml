"is known to spend time on Freenode, 2600, Indymedia and OFTC.  <br/><br/> If "
"you're currently able to connect to one of those IRC networks, look for a "

"torproject.org</tt>'. Send the user a private message like so: <br/> <br/> "
"'<tt>/msg gettor xdcc list</tt>' <br/> <br/> The <tt>gettor</tt> user should "
"respond with a list of files available for download. If there is no "
"response, something has gone wrong. Some IRC networks require that you are "
"registered before you can send private queries to other users (this is often "
"to reduce spam). You may need to register with the NickServ before you can "
"talk to the <tt>'gettor'</tt> user.  <br/> An example response returned by "
