"<b>Relays:</b> There are already statistics covering the data that relays "
"report about themselves and which are confirmed in parts by the directory "
"authorities. The <a href=\"http://torstatus.kgprog.com/\">TorStatus</a> "
"project evaluates the hourly published directories containing lists of all "
"running relays and keeps track of their uptimes and advertised bandwidths. "
"However, an aggregate view of the development of relays over an extended "
"period of time is still missing. In addition to that, all information about "
"provided bandwidth capacity as reported by the relays is not necessarily "
"trustworthy. There has not been a comprehensive measurement of relay "
"performance so far to validate bandwidth claims and relay stability."

"<b>Bridges:</b> A special type of relays is running as bridges. Bridges are "
"relaying traffic, too, but are not listed in the public directory. The "
"purpose of bridges is to allow censored clients to connect to the Tor "
"network without their censor being able to prohibit access easily. The "
"number and capacity of bridges is therefore not publicly known and has not "
"been evaluated, yet."

"<b>Clients:</b> Little is known about usage of the Tor network. In "
"particular, the number and location of clients are largely unknown. A rough "
"estimation is that there are a few hundreds of thousands of clients in the "
"network; a number which is very hard to verify. There are no recent studies "
"on the number of Tor users which would help obtaining a better picture on "
"usage of the Tor network. Clearly, all investigations of clients need to be "
"performed with special care and in highly aggregated form to protect users' "
"anonymity."
