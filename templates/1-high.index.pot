"Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a "

"Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed "
"network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents "
"somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you "
"visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical "
"location.  Tor works with many of your existing applications, including web "
"browsers, instant messaging clients, remote login, and other applications "
"based on the TCP protocol."
