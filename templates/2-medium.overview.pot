"Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance known "
"as \"traffic analysis.\" Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is "
"talking to whom over a public network.  Knowing the source and destination "
"of your Internet traffic allows others to track your behavior and "
"interests.  This can impact your checkbook if, for example, an e-commerce "
"site uses price discrimination based on your country or institution of "
"origin.  It can even threaten your job and physical safety by revealing who "
"and where you are. For example, if you're travelling abroad and you connect "
"to your employer's computers to check or send mail, you can inadvertently "
"reveal your national origin and professional affiliation to anyone observing "
"the network, even if the connection is encrypted."

"How does traffic analysis work? Internet data packets have two parts: a data "
"payload and a header used for routing.  The data payload is whatever is "
"being sent, whether that's an email message, a web page, or an audio file.  "
"Even if you encrypt the data payload of your communications, traffic "
"analysis still reveals a great deal about what you're doing and, possibly, "
"what you're saying.  That's because it focuses on the header, which "
"discloses source, destination, size, timing, and so on."

"A basic problem for the privacy minded is that the recipient of your "

"authorized intermediaries like Internet service providers, and sometimes "

"might involve sitting somewhere between sender and recipient on the network, "
"looking at headers."

"But there are also more powerful kinds of traffic analysis.  Some attackers "
"spy on multiple parts of the Internet and use sophisticated statistical "
"techniques to track the communications patterns of many different "
"organizations and individuals.  Encryption does not help against these "
"attackers, since it only hides the content of Internet traffic, not the "
"headers."

"Tor helps to reduce the risks of both simple and sophisticated traffic "

"similar to using a twisty, hard-to-follow route in order to throw off "
"somebody who is tailing you &mdash; and then periodically erasing your "
"footprints.  Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, "
"data packets on the Tor network take a random pathway through several relays "
"that cover your tracks so no observer at any single point can tell where the "
"data came from or where it's going."

"To create a private network pathway with Tor, the user's software or client "

"giving data to.  No individual relay ever knows the complete path that a "
