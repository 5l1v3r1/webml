    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#WhereDidVidaliaGo">Where did the world map 
    (Vidalia) go?</a></h3>

    <p>Vidalia has been replaced with Tor Launcher, which is a Firefox 
    extension that provides similar functionality. Unfortunately, circuit 
    status reporting is still missing, but we are <a 
    href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8641">working 
    on providing it</a>. </p>

    <p>In the meantime, we are providing standalone Vidalia packages for 
    people who still want the map. Windows and Linux versions are <a 
    href="â€‹https://people.torproject.org/~erinn/vidalia-standalone-bundles/">
    available here</a>. 

    <p>To use these packages, extract them, then run the startup script. 
    On Windows, this is "Start Vidalia.exe". On Linux, it is start-vidalia. 
    They can be placed in a different directory from TBB (and likely should 
    be). </p>

    <p>This Vidalia package will only run properly if Tor Browser has already 
    been launched. You cannot start it before launching Tor Browser. </p>

    <p>MacOS is still under development, but in the mean time you can modify 
    your TBB 2.x to be a standalone Vidalia (and then use it after starting 
    TBB 3.x) by opening your TBB 2.x vidalia.conf file in an editor and 
    replacing its contents with just these lines:</p>

    <pre>
    [General]
    LanguageCode=en

    [Tor]
    ControlPort=9151
    TorExecutable=.
    Torrc=.
    DataDirectory=.
    AuthenticationMethod=cookie
    </pre>

    <a id="DisableJS"></a>
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#DisableJS">How do I disable JavaScript?</a>
    </h3>

    <p>Alas, Mozilla decided to get rid of the config checkbox for JavaScript 
    from earlier Firefox versions. And since TBB 3.5 is based on Firefox 24 
    (FF17 is unmaintained), that means TBB 3.5 doesn't have the config 
    checkbox anymore either, which is unfortunate.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to disable JavaScript in TBB 3.5 is to click on the 
    Noscript "S" (between the green onion and the address bar), and select 
    "Forbid scripts globally". Note that vanilla NoScript actually whitelists 
    several domains even when you try to disable scripts globally, whereas 
    Tor Browser's NoScript configuration disables all of them. </p>

    <p>The more klunky way to disable JavaScript is to go to about:config, 
    find javascript.enabled, and set it to false.</p>

    <p>There is also a very simple addon available at addons.mozilla.org
    called QuickJS, which provides a toolbar toggle for the javascript.enabled
    about:config control. There are no configuration options for the addon, 
    it just switches the javascript.enabled entry between true and false and 
    provides a button for it. </p>

    <p>If you want to be extra safe, use both the about:config setting and 
    NoScript. </p>

    <p>As for whether you should disable it or leave it enabled, that's <a 
    href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBJavaScriptEnabled">a 
    tradeoff we leave to you</a>.</p>

    <a id="VerifyDownload"></a>
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#VerifyDownload">How do I verify the download
    (sha256sums.txt)?</a></h3>

    <p>You can still verify your Tor Browser download by downloading the 
    signature file (.asc) along with your package and <a 
    href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en">
    checking the GPG signature</a> as before. We now have an additional 
    verification method that allows you to verify the build as well as 
    the download.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Download the Tor Browser package, the sha256sums.txt file, and the
      sha256sums signature files. They can all be found in the same directory 
      under <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">
      https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/</a>, for example in 3.5 
      for TBB 3.5.</li>
      <li>Retrieve the signers' GPG keys. This can be done from the command 
      line by entering something like 
      <pre>gpg --keyserver keys.mozilla.org --recv-keys 0x29846B3C683686CC</pre>
      (This will bring you developer Mike Perry's public key. Other 
      developers' key IDs can be found on
      <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en">this 
      page</a>.)</li>
      <li>Verify the sha256sums.txt file by executing this command:
      <pre>gpg --verify &lt;NAME OF THE SIGNATURE FILE&gt;.asc sha256sums.txt</pre></li>
      <li>You should see a message like "Good signature from &lt;DEVELOPER 
      NAME&gt;". If you don't, there is a problem. Try these steps again.</li>
      <li>Now you can take the sha256sum of the Tor Browser package. On 
      Windows you can use the <a href="http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/">
      hashdeep utility</a> and run
      <pre>C:\location\where\you\saved\hashdeep -c sha256sum &lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.exe</pre>
      On Mac or Linux you can run <pre>sha256sum &lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.zip</pre> or <pre>sha256sum &lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.tar.gz</pre> without having to download a utility.</li>
      <li>You will see a string of letters and numbers.</li>
      <li>Open sha256sums.txt in a text editor.</li>
      <li>Locate the name of the Tor Browser file you downloaded.</li>
      <li>Compare the string of letters and numbers to the left of your
      filename with the string of letters and numbers that appeared 
      on your command line. If they match, you've successfully verified the 
      build.</li> 
    </ul>

    modify them yourself with the latest Tor Browser Bundle filename.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#PluggableTransports">How do I use pluggable transports?</a></h3>

    <p>
    For now, the Pluggable Transports-capable TBB is still a separate 
    unofficial package. Download them <a 
    href="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/pt-bundle/3.5-pt20131217/">
    here</a>. We hope to have combined packages available in a beta soon.
    </p>

    <p>
    The separate Pluggable Transports-capable TBB is different from the 
    Pluggable Transports bundles that have been released in the past. 
    They include the programs necessary to use obfsproxy and flash proxy, 
    but the pluggable transports are not enabled by default. You must 
    enable them manually by adding Bridge lines to the torrc file. 
    (Please see ticket <a 
    href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10418">#10418</a> 
    for how we hope to make it easier to do in the future.)
    </p>

    <p>
    To enable <b>obfsproxy</b>, edit the file called Data/Tor/torrc inside the 
    bundle and add the lines: 
    </p>

    <p>
    To enable <b>flash proxy</b>, edit the file called Data/Tor/torrc inside the

    <a id="NewIdentityClosingTabs"></a>
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#NewIdentityClosingTabs">Why does "New 
    Identity" close all my open tabs?</a></h3>

    <p>
    That's actually a feature, since it's discarding your application-level 
    browser data too. But it sure is a surprising feature, for people who 
    are used to Vidalia's "new identity" behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
    We're working on ways to make the behavior less surprising, e.g. a popup 
    warning or auto restoring tabs. See ticket <a 
    href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9906">#9906</a> and 
    ticket <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10400">
    #10400</a> to follow progress there.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the mean time, you can get Vidalia's old "newnym" functionality by 
    attaching a Vidalia to your TBB3.x. See the instructions above.
    </p>

    <a id="ConfigureRelayOrBridge"></a>
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#ConfigureRelayOrBridge">How do I configure Tor as a relay or bridge?</a></h3>

    <p>
    You've got three options. 
    </p>

    <p>
    First (best option), if you're on Linux, you can install the system 
    Tor package (e.g. apt-get install tor) and then set it up to be a relay 
    (<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-relay-debian">instructions</a>). 
    You can then use TBB independent of that.
    </p>

    <p>
    Second (simpler option), if you're on Windows, you can fetch the separate 
    "Vidalia relay bundle" or "Vidalia bridge bundle" from the download page 
    and then use that (again you can use TBB independent of it). 
    </p>

    <p>
    Third (complex option), you can either hook your Vidalia up to TBB (as 
    described in the FAQ above) or edit your torrc file (in Data/Tor/torrc) 
    directly to add the following lines: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    ORPort 443
    Exitpolicy reject *:*
    BridgeRelay 1  # only add this line if you want to be a bridge
    </pre>
    <p>
    If you've installed <a 
    href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-debian-instructions.html.en#instructions">Obfsproxy</a>, 
    you'll need to add one more line:
    </p>
    <pre>
    ServerTransportPlugin obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed
    </pre>
    <p>
    This third option is pretty klunky right now; see e.g. <a 
    href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10449">this bug</a>; 
    but we're hoping it will become an easy option in the future. 
    </p>

    <a id="Timestamps"></a>
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#Timestamps">Why are the file timestamps 
    from 2000?</a></h3>

    <p>One of the huge new features in TBB 3.x is the "deterministic build" 
    process, which allows many people to build the Tor Browser Bundle and 
    verify that they all make exactly the same package. See Mike's <a 
    href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">first 
    blog</a> post for the motivation, and his <a 
    href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">second
    blog post</a> for the technical details of how we do it. 
    </p>

    <p>Part of creating identical builds is having everybody use the same 
    timestamp. Mike picked the beginning of 2000 for that time. The reason 
    you might see 7pm in 1999 is because of time zones. </p>
