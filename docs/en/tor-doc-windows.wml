    <br>
    
    <p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
    people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
    at least 100 KiloBytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
    Tor to be a relay too. We have many features that make Tor relays easy
    and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
    you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
    IP addresses.</p>
    
    <p>Having relays in many different places on the Internet is what
    makes Tor users secure. <a
    href="<wikifaq>#RelayAnonymity">You
    may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
    since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
    computer or were relayed from others.</p>
