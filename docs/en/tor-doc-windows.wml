    <p>
    Microsoft Windows bundles contain <a href="<page index>">Tor</a>, <a
    href="<page projects/vidalia>">Vidalia</a> (a GUI for Tor), <a
    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275/">Torbutton</a> (a plugin for Mozilla Firefox), and <a
    href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/">Polipo</a>
    (a web proxy) packaged into one bundle, with the four applications
    pre-configured to work together.  Download either the <a
    href="../<package-win32-bundle-stable>">stable</a> or the <a
    href="../<package-win32-bundle-alpha>">experimental</a> version of
    the Windows bundle, or look for more options on the <a href="<page
    download/download>">download page</a>.
    </p>
    
    <img alt="tor installer splash page" src="$(IMGROOT)/screenshot-win32-installer-splash.png">
    
    <p>If you have previously installed Tor, Vidalia, or Polipo
    you can deselect whichever components you do not need to install
    in the dialog shown below.
    </p>
    
    <img alt="select components to install" src="$(IMGROOT)/screenshot-win32-installer-components.png">
    
    <p>After you have completed the installer, the components
    you selected will automatically be started for you.
    </p>
    
    <p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
    default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
    the settings. Tor is now installed.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>After installing Tor and Polipo, you need to configure your
    applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>
    
    <p>You should use Tor with Firefox and Torbutton,
    for best safety. The bundle installs the <a
    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275/">Torbutton plugin</a>
    for you. Restart your Firefox, and you're all set:
    </p>
    
    <img alt="Torbutton plugin for Firefox" src="$(IMGROOT)/screenshot-torbutton.png"/>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
    If you plan to run Firefox on a different computer than Tor, see the <a
    href="<wikifaq>#SocksListenAddress">FAQ
    entry for running Tor on a different computer</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
    point them at Polipo (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
    directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
    your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
    href="<wikifaq>#SOCKSAndDNS">this
    FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
    that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at SocksCap or
    <a href="http://www.freecap.ru/eng/">FreeCap</a>.
    (FreeCap is free software; SocksCap is proprietary.)</p>
    
    <p>For information on how to Torify other applications, check out the
    <a href="<wiki>/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
    HOWTO</a>.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Three: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>
    Check to see that Vidalia is running.  Vidalia uses a small green onion
    to indicate Tor is running or a dark onion with a red "X" when Tor is
    not running. You can start or stop Tor by right-clicking
    on Vidalia's icon in your system tray and selecting "Start" or "Stop"
    from the menu as shown below:
    </p>
    
    <img alt="Vidalia Tray Icon" src="$(IMGROOT)/screenshot-win32-vidalia.png"/>
    
    <p>
    Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
    sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on <a
    href="https://check.torproject.org/">the Tor detector</a> and see
    whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.  (If that site is down, see <a
    href="<wikifaq>#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
    FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
    </p>
    
    <p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
    ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
    your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
    your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
    it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
    href="<wikifaq>#FirewalledClient">this
    FAQ entry</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>If it's still not working, look at <a
    href="<wikifaq>#ItDoesntWork">this
    FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>
    
    <p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Step Four: Configure it as a relay</a></h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
    people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
    at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
    Tor to be a relay too. We have many features that make Tor relays easy
    and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
    you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
    IP addresses.</p>
    
    <p>Having relays in many different places on the Internet is what
    makes Tor users secure. <a
    href="<wikifaq>#RelayAnonymity">You
    may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
    since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
    computer or were relayed from others.</p>

    guide.</p>
