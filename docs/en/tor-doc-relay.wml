    <h1>Configuring a Tor relay</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
    The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
    people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
    at least 2 megabits/s for both upload and download, please help out
    Tor by configuring your Tor to be a relay too.
    </p>

    <p>You can run a Tor relay on pretty much any operating system. Tor relays
    work best on Linux, OS X Lion or later, FreeBSD 5.x+, NetBSD 5.x+, and
    Windows Server 2003 or later.
    </p>

    <p>
    The best approach for most users is to <a href="<page
    docs/tor-relay-debian>">run your relay on Debian or Ubuntu</a> using
    the system Tor package &mdash; the deb takes care of running Tor as a
    separate user, making sure it has enough file descriptors available,
    starting it at boot, and so on. Tor relays also run nicely on other
    Linux flavors, and on FreeBSD and NetBSD for those who are comfortable
    with those operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>Alas, since Vidalia (a graphical interface for Tor) is <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#WhereDidVidaliaGo">no longer included</a>
    in Tor Browser, there are currently no
    easy relay packages for Windows and OS X users. One option might be to run
    Debian in a VM, or use a different means of getting a Tor binary on
    your system (Expert Bundle, Homebrew, Macports). Please help make
    this process easier!

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#torrc">Configure Tor by editing the torrc file</a></h2>
    <br />

    <p>
    Tor's
    configuration file is named 'torrc'. In the Tor Browser folder, it's
    located at</p>
    <pre>Data\Tor\torrc</pre>
    <p>Open the file with a text editor and add the following lines:</p>

    <pre>
    ORPort 443
    Exitpolicy reject *:*
    Nickname ididntedittheconfig
    ContactInfo human@...
    </pre>

    <p>If you want to be a bridge, read about the BridgeRelay and
    ServerTransportPlugin values <a
    href="<page projects/obfsproxy-instructions>#instructions">on
    this page</a>.</p>

    <p>Tor will use all your bandwidth if you don't set limits for it. Some
    options are described in <a href="<page docs/faq>#LimitTotalBandwidth">these</a>
    <a href="<page docs/faq>#BandwidthShaping">FAQ entries</a>.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/src/config/torrc.sample.in">sample
    torrc file</a> and the <a
    href="<page docs/tor-manual>">man
    page</a> for other Tor options you may want to set.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#check">Make sure your relay is reachable</a></h2>
    <br>

    <p>If you are using a firewall, open a hole in your firewall
    so incoming connections can reach the ports you configured
    (ORPort, plus DirPort if you enabled it). If you have a
    hardware firewall (Linksys box, cable modem, etc) you might find <a
    href="http://portforward.com/">portforward.com</a> useful. Also, make sure you
    allow all <em>outgoing</em> connections too, so your relay can reach the
    other Tor relays.
    </p>

    <p>Restart your relay. If it <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#Logs">logs
    any warnings</a>, address them.
    </p>

    <p>As soon as your relay manages to connect to the network, it will
    try to determine whether the ports you configured are reachable from
    the outside. This step is usually fast, but may take up to 20
    minutes. Look for a <a href="<page docs/faq>#Logs">log entry</a> like
    <pre>Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent.</pre>
    If you don't see this message, it means that your relay is not reachable
    from the outside &mdash; you should re-check your firewalls, check that it's
    testing the IP and port you think it should be testing, etc.
    </p>

    <p>When your relay has decided that it's reachable, it will upload a "server
    descriptor" to the directories, to let clients know
    what address, ports, keys, etc your relay is using. You can search <a
    href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a> or <a
    href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a> for
    the nickname you configured, to make sure it's there. You may need to wait
    up to one hour for the directories to publish the new server information.</p>
