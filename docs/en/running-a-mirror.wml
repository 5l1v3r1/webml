    <h1>Tor: Running a Mirror</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Thank you for wanting to mirror the Tor website.  All of
    our mirrors are publicly listed on <a href="<page getinvolved/mirrors>">our mirrors
    page</a>.  We've included some sample commands and configuration below
    to make the initial setup and ongoing maintenance a minimal effort.
    The Tor website and distribution directory currently require 8.0 GB of
    disk space.</p>

    <p>
    If you would like to run a mirror, it's as easy as this command to download
    everything a mirror should share with the world:
    <br> <br>
    <tt>
    rsync -av --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/website-mirror tor-mirror/
    </tt>

    <p>
    In order to assure we have reliable and up to date mirrors,
    please ensure your mirror does at least the following:<br/><br/>

    Updates <b>no less</b> than every six hours, but no more frequent than every
    hour.<br/><br/>

    Allows "Directory Index / Indexes" (Index viewing) of the /dist
    directory.<br/><br/>

    Allows "Multiviews" or equivalent for language localization.<br/><br/>

    Have a valid contact email for administrative communications should your
    server have issues.<br/><br/>

    It is highly recommended for all mirror operators to subscribe to <A
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors">tor-mirrors mailing
    list</A> where all mirror listing modification requests should go (ADD,
    CHANGE, DELETE, any other requests/notifications).  Also, any technical
    assistance in setting up your mirror may be found here as well.<br/><br/>

    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    An example cronjob to update a full mirror once every 6 hours may look like so:
    <tt>
    <pre>
    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    0 */6 * * * rsync -aq --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/website-mirror/ /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org
    </pre>
    </tt>
    </p>
    <br/>
    For mirror operators that use Apache, we have created a sample virtual host
    configuration file to use:
    <tt>
    <pre>
    &lt;VirtualHost 10.10.10.10:80&gt;
            ServerAdmin youremail@example.com<br/>
            ServerName  ServerNameHere<br/>

            DocumentRoot /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org<br/>

            &lt;Directory /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org/&gt;<br/>
                Options MultiViews Indexes<br/>
                DirectoryIndex index<br/>
                AllowOverride None<br/>
            &lt;/Directory&gt;<br/>

    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
    </pre>
    </tt>
    <br/>
    For mirror operators that use nginx, we created a sample virtual host
    configuration file to use:
    <tt>
    <pre>
    server {
    	listen 10.10.10.10:80;
  	server_name your.example.com;

  	root /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org;
	index index.html.en;

	location ^~ /dist/ {
	  autoindex on;
      }
    }
    </pre>
    </tt>
    <br/>
    If you use nginx, please ensure the text/html line in
    <tt>/etc/ngnix/mime.types</tt> matches:
    <tt>
    <pre>
    text/html                             en html htm shtml;
    </pre>
    </tt>
    <br/><br>
    Please ensure that you keep your mirror updated (we suggest automating this
    task with something like '<tt>cron</tt>'). Our website, source code and
    binary releases change often. An update frequency of six hours is recommended.  Tor users everywhere will thank you.
    </p>

    If you are running a mirror, please subscribe to the <A
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors">tor-mirrors
    mailing list</A>, and introduce yourself there.
    We will add you to the mirror list.
    Help for mirror support and configuration issues may also be found on the list.
