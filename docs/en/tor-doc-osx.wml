    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#installing">Step One: Download and Install Tor</a></h2>
    <br />
    
    <p>
    The install for Macintosh OS X bundles
    <a href="<page index>">Tor</a>,
    <a href="<page projects/vidalia>">Vidalia</a> (a graphical interface for Tor),
    <a href="<page torbutton/index>">Torbutton</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/">Polipo</a> (a web proxy)
    into one package, with the four applications pre-configured to work
    together.
    Download either the <a href="../<package-osx-bundle-stable>">stable</a>
    or the <a href="../<package-osx-bundle-alpha>">experimental</a> version
    of the OS X bundle for Intel, or look for more options on the <a href="<page
    download/download>">download page</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Once you've downloaded the dmg, double-click and let it mount.
    Browse to the now open Vidalia Bundle in Finder.  It's easy to install the bundle; simply drag and drop the Vidalia
    onion icon to the Applications folder.  Optionally, double click the
    "install torbutton" script and let it install torbutton into Firefox.
    You can also get Torbutton from Mozilla Add-ons by searching for
    "torbutton".</p>
    
    <p>When you are finished installing, you can start Vidalia by selecting its icon
    from your Applications folder. A dark onion with a red X in your dock means
    Tor is not currently running. You can start Tor by selecting Start from the
    "Tor" menu at the top of your screen.
    </p>
    
    <p>When Tor is running, Vidalia's dock icon will look like the following:
    </p>
    
    <p><img alt="vidalia running tor"
    src="../img/screenshot-osx-vidalia.png"
    border="1"/></p>
    
    <p>Polipo is installed as part of the Tor bundle package
    installer. Once it is installed, it will start automatically when your
    computer is restarted.
    You do not need to configure Polipo to use Tor &mdash; a custom Polipo 
    configuration for Tor has been installed as part of the installer package.
    </p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#using">Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</a></h2>
    <br />
    
    <p>After installing, you need to configure your
    applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>
    
    <p>You should use Tor with Firefox and Torbutton, for best safety.
    Torbutton was installed for you.  Click on the red "Tor Disabled" toggle button to
    turn Tor on, and you're all set: </p>
    
    <p><img alt="Torbutton plugin for Firefox"
    src="../img/screenshot-torbutton.png"
    border="1"/></p>
    
    <p>
    If you plan to run Firefox on a different computer than Tor, see the <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SocksListenAddress">FAQ
    entry for running Tor on a different computer</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
    point them at Polipo (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
    directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
    your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
    FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
    that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
    href="http://www.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">connect</a> or
    <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.</p>

    HOWTO</a>.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#verify">Step Three: Make sure it's working</a></h2>
    <br />
    
    <p>
    Next, you should try using your browser with Tor and make
    sure that your IP address is being anonymized. Click on
    <a href="https://check.torproject.org/">the
    Tor detector</a>
    and see whether it thinks you're using Tor or not.
    (If that site is down, see <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IsMyConnectionPrivate">this
    FAQ entry</a> for more suggestions on how to test your Tor.)
    </p>
    
    <p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
    ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
    your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
    your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
    it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
    FAQ entry</a>.

    <p>If it's still not working, look at <a

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#relay">Step Four: Configure it as a relay</a></h2>
    <br />
    
    <p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more
    people who run relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you have
    at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring your
    Tor to be a relay too. We have many features that make Tor relays easy
    and convenient, including rate limiting for bandwidth, exit policies so
    you can limit your exposure to abuse complaints, and support for dynamic
    IP addresses.</p>
    
    <p>Having relays in many different places on the Internet is what
    makes Tor users secure. <a
    href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RelayAnonymity">You
    may also get stronger anonymity yourself</a>,
    since remote sites can't know whether connections originated at your
    computer or were relayed from others.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#uninstall">How To Uninstall Tor and Privoxy</a></h2>
    <br />
    
    <p>There are two ways to uninstall the bundle from your computer, using
    Finder or a command line or Terminal-based uninstaller.  If you want to remove Tor on OSX, here's how:</p>
    
    <p>Change your application proxy settings back to their original values.
       If you just want to stop using Tor, you can end at this point.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to completely remove Tor, and your account has Admin
    Privileges, then proceed as follows:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Open Finder and click on Applications.</li>
    <li>Drag /Applications/Vidalia to the Trash.</li>
    <li>Remove /Library/Torbutton from your system.</li>
    <li>In your home directory, go to Library, remove the Vidalia
    directory</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Tor, Vidalia, and Polipo are now completely removed from your system.</p>
    
    <p>If you're familiar with the command line or Terminal, you can
    manually remove the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>/Applications/Vidalia.app/</li>
    <li>/Library/Torbutton/</li>
    <li>~/Library/Vidalia</li>
    <li>~/.tor</li>
    </ul>
