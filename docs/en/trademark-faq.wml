    <h1>Tor Trademark Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <hr />
    
    <a id="usage"></a>
    <h2>How can I use the name "Tor"?</h2>
    <p>The Tor Project encourages developers to use the name Tor in ways that
    do not confuse the public about the source of anonymity software and
    services.  If you are building open-source non-commercial software or
    services that incorporate or work with The Tor Project's code, you may
    use the name “Tor” in an accurate description of your work.  We ask you
    to include a link to the official Tor website
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a> so users can verify the original source of
    Tor for themselves, and a note indicating that your project is not
    sponsored by The Tor Project. For example, “This product is produced
    independently from the Tor&#174; anonymity software and carries no guarantee
    from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.”</p>
    
    <a id="onionlogo"></a>
    <h2>Can I use the Tor onion logo?</h2>
    <p>If you're making non-commercial use of Tor software, you may also use
    the Tor onion logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your
    products).  Please don't modify the design or colors of the logo.  You
    can use items that look like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point
    (e.g. an exploded onion with layers, for instance), so long as they're
    not used as logos in ways that would confuse people.</p>
    
    <a id="combining"></a>
    <h2>Can I use the word "Tor" as part of the name of my product or my domain name?</h2>
    <p>We recommend that you don't do this, but rather find a name that will
    accurately identify <i>your</i> products or services.  Remember that our goal
    is to make sure that people aren't confused about whether your product
    or project is made or endorsed by The Tor Project. Creating a new brand
    that incorporates the Tor brand is likely to lead to confusion.</p>
    
    <a id="enforcing"></a>
    <h2>Does this mean you're enforcing trademark rights?</h2>
    <p>The Tor Project is a non-profit corporation organized to research and
    develop the Tor anonymity software and network.  We don't want to be
    trademark bullies, but we will use trademark to protect the public's
    ability to recognize Tor Project software.  Trademark law helps us to assure
    that the name is used only in connection with genuine Tor anonymity
    software and for accurate description of software and services.
    After all, to protect their anonymity securely, computer users must be
    able to identify the software they are using, so they can account
    properly for its strengths and weaknesses.  Tor has become well-known as
    a software package and associated network of onion-routing anonymizing
    proxies, with online documentation, instructions for strengthening
    anonymity protection, and warnings that even at this stage it remains
    experimental software.  We work with developers to improve the software
    and network and actively encourage researchers to document attacks to
    help us strengthen its anonymity protection further.  We distribute the
    software itself freely, but require correct attribution. </p>
    
    <a id="commercial"></a>
    <h2>What if I produce non-open source, commercial products based on
    Tor?</h2>
    <p>Contact us, and let's talk.</p>
    
    <a id="licensee"></a>
    <h2>Are there official licensees of the Tor trademarks?</h2>
    <p>Yes.  A few open source, non-commercial projects are Tor trademark
    licensees:</p>

    System</a></li>
