<h1>Configuring your browser to use <a href="<page index>">Tor</a></h1>
<br />

<p>If you're using Firefox (we recommend it), you don't need this page.
Simply install the <a
href="http://freehaven.net/~squires/torbutton/">Torbutton
plugin</a>, restart your Firefox, and you're all set:
</p>

<br />

<p>Otherwise, you need to manually configure your browser's proxy
settings.
In Mozilla and Firefox on Windows/Linux, this is in
Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
In Firefox on OS X, it's Firefox|Preferences|General|Connection Settings.
In Opera 7.5x it's Tools|Preferences|Network|Proxy servers.
In IE, it's Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Check Proxy
Server|Advanced.</p>

<p>
You should fill in "localhost"
and "8118" to point the top four protocols to Privoxy, as shown here. (Even
though Privoxy doesn't support FTP and Gopher, <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">you
should set them up anyway</a>.) You should also fill out the socks              proxy entry to point directly to Tor ("localhost", "9050", and socks5)
to cover protocols besides the first four. Then click "OK".</p>
