<h1>Tor: Open Positions</h1>
<hr>

<p>Tor is hiring!  We're looking for self-motivated individuals who are
able to work independently and want to help make Tor better.  These are
short-term contract positions ranging from one to three months.</p>

<p>In particular, we're looking for a few people:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#vidaliadev">Vidalia Developer</a></li>
<li><a href="#windowsdev">Microsoft Windows Developer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Working on Tor is rewarding because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can work your own hours in your own locations. As long as you
get the job done, we don't care about the process.</li>
<li>We only write free (open source) software. The tools you make won't
be locked down or rot on a shelf.</li>
<li>You will work with a world-class team of anonymity experts and
developers on what is already the largest and most active strong anonymity
network ever.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want you to have good communication and writing skills (in particular,
you should know how to keep other project members informed of your
progress), and we want you to know how to figure out what needs doing and
then take the initiative to do it. Most project members play more than
one role, so combination developer/activists are very welcome.</p>

<p>The best way to get noticed as a good developer is to join the community
and start helping out. Smart code commits and ideas are welcome anytime.
We have a great core group of developers working on the Tor software
itself as well as supporting software like Vidalia, Torbutton, etc. All
of our contractors came through volunteering first.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#vidaliadev">Vidalia Developer</a></h3>
<p><a href="<page projects/vidalia>">Vidalia</a> is the cross-platform graphical user interface to Tor written
in C++ using the Qt libraries.  It is used by millions of people
successfully.  Our current developer is a volunteer and otherwise
occupied with finishing his PhD.  We're looking for someone who knows
C++, Qt, and would like to kickstart development on the next generation
of Vidalia.  Some suggested next steps involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the KDE Marble interface into Vidalia for better and
more accurate mappings of relays to countries.  Plus, it just looks
cool.</li>
<li>Implementing the ability to click a country and instruct Tor to
either start or end circuits in that country.</li>
<li>Work on bug fixes and enhancements as suggested by users.</li>
<li>Give Vidalia the ability to control the http proxy included, to
start, stop, and possibly configure either privoxy, polipo, or an http
shim we ship in the combined bundles of tor, vidalia, and polipo.</li>
<li>Possibly re-design the Vidalia interface to have different modes for
different levels of user sophistication.  Many users see a button or a
setting and feel they have to change it.  The defaults are set to ensure
users are sufficiently anonymous.  How can we better hide the complexity
of Tor configurations?</li>
</ul>

<a id="windowsdev"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#windowsdev">Microsoft Windows Developer</a></h3>
<p>This person needs to be very familiar with Windows at a system and
network level.  We're looking or someone to help make Tor on Windows
more compatible and work more reliably as a relay.
There are a number of projects relating to Windows that current need a
skilled developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a Tor network shim to redirect all traffic through Tor.
OpenVPN has a network layer device for Windows that redirects traffic
through the OpenVPN connection.  Is this the model Tor should be using?
Or is there something else that may work better?</li>
<li>Tor relays under non-server editions of Windows run into WSAENOBUFS
problems after a short while.  This problem is described in detail in <a
href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/98">bug ticket
98</a>.  So far, there are no solutions. We think libevent 2.0 with its
bufferevents code will help solve the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Periodically we get new funding to work on more development
projects.  Your goal should be to get into the list of <a href="<page
about/corepeople>">core project members</a> so we think of you when new
funding arrives.</p>
