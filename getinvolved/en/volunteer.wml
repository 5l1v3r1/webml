    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#gsoc">Google Summer of Code</a></h2>

    <p>
    Tor is also taking part in this year's <a
    href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google
    Summer of Code</a>! The criteria for this is a little different - either
    gender can apply but you need to be either <a
    href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#2._Whos_eligible_to_participate_as_a">a
    present student or just graduated</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    As mentioned above if you're eligible for either program then please apply
    for both! Google Summer of Code is a far, far larger program for us than
    OPW so your chances of being applied that way are considerably better.

    <br><br>
    <p>
    The Tor code is more than 10 years old in places, and we haven't always had
    enough time or wisdom to write things as well as we could have.  Our unit
    test coverage is shamefully low, and the dependency graph of our modules is
    shamefully convoluted . We could use refactoring and unit tests!  Please
    look through the Tor source code and look for ugly or tricky code or
    dependencies -- the uglier and trickier the better -- and think about how
    you could make the code look better, read better, and (subject to testing)
    work better.
    </p>

    <p>
    If this is for a fun side-project, it would be great for you to work on
    anything that can be made better and more tested.  For an internship-level
    position, we'd hope that you could find a number of particularly tricky or
    knotty piece of the code to clean up, and aim for resolving the ugliest
    problems, not necessarily the easiest.
    </p>

    <p>
    For a big project here, it would be great to pick one of the major
    "submodules" of Tor -- path selection, node discovery, directory authority
    operations, directory service -- and refactor its interface completely, to
    minify and codify its points of contact with the rest of Tor.

    <b>As part of your application for this project please identify one of the

The feature should also add support for including only packet capture data that

    <br><br>
    <p>
Right now, our unit test coverage with the tests we ship is around 30%
-- only 30% of the executable lines in our source are reached by the
unit tests.  Improving this test coverage could make Tor development
much more reliable.
    </p>

    <p>
So we need better unit tests, and we need better integration tests too.
    </p>

    <p>
Improving unit tests would involve refactoring functions to be more
testable, and writing a bunch of unit tests.
    </p>

    <p>
Improving integration tests would involve refactoring and improving
the "chutney" program that launches a test tor network, and writing a
bunch of tests to see what works and what doesn't work on such a
network.  It could also involve writing tests using the library "<a
href="https://stem.torproject.org/">stem</a>" to script individual clients on a
Chutney network.
    </p>

    <p>
To get a feel for how testing works in Tor today, download Tor and
Chutney, and make sure you can build Tor and use Chutney.  See how the
unit tests work by skimming some of the test code in the src/test
subdirectory.  Try computing test coverage (according to the
instructions in the doc/HACKING file.
    </p>

    <p>
Also, have a look at the one current integration test that works on
chutney today: it is a shell script distributed with Tor as
src/test/test-tor-network.sh .  We probably don't want to have all of
our integration tests be written as shell scripts, but it's interesting
to see how one works.
    </p>

    <p>
If working on designs for an improved or refactored Chutney, watch out for <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">"archicture
astronautics"</a>: while it's important that we have a well-designed and
maintainable Chutney architecture, it wouldn't be very useful if a good
architecture were the <em>only</em> outcome here: we need tests too.
    </p>

    <p>
As part of the application process, please contribute a patch that makes
a non-trivial improvement to chutney, and/or include a new test for some
interesting Tor function. (Please pick a function that isn't completely
easy to test.)

    <b>Have the Tor daemon use more cores</b>
    <br>
    Language: <i>C</i>
    <br>
    Likely Mentors: <i>David (dgoulet)</i>
    <br><br>
    <p>
Right now, if you run a busy Tor server on a multicore computer, most of
the cores are mostly unused.  We have a "cpuworker" mechanism to move
expensive computations into worker threads, but that mechanism is
currently only used for a small fraction of our cryptography.  Moving
more work into the worker threads could improve performance immensely.
    </p>

    <p>
So it would be great to parallelize our cryptography more in order to
better handle more cores.  See

<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7572">ticket 7572</a> for some subtickets
on our tracker.
    </p>

    <p>
(If you're reading through the code to see how it works today, you will
also want to have a look at the new implementation for cpuworkers
described in <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9682">9682</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
Completing the implementation of ticket #7572 --which would move our
circuit crypto onto separate threads-- could be a good summer project.
Alternatively, moving all of the signature generation and verification
code onto the cpuworkers could be fun.  In either case, you will have
some important architectural decisions to make about how to minimize
shared data between the main thread and the workers, how to avoid
race conditions between them, and how to test it all to make sure it has
no hidden failure cases.

    <p>
We're working on a revamp of the entire Tor hidden service design to
improve the security and reliability of the hidden service system.
    </p>

    <p>
This is a big project: see
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt">proposal

part of that?
    </p>

    <p>
This is a very ambitious project, so we're deliberately not suggesting
particular sub-topics.  If you're interested in participating, try to
read and understand the <a

    <br><br>
    <p>
Right now, you can only use Tor's DNS support to look up IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, and to fetch PTR records.  But DNS can do so much more!
    </p>

    <p>
<a
href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/219-expanded-dns.txt">Proposal
219</a> describes some new cell types that Tor could use to support
more types of DNS over Tor.
    </p>

    <p>
To see how Tor implements its existing DNS lookups, start by tracing the
the connection_exit_begin_resolve() function in src/or/connection_edge.c ,
and see how we pass these requests downwards through src/or/dns.c to the
underlying resolver.  It's not too complicated, but there are some
tricky parts to understand.

    <b>Exitmap Improvements</b>
    <br>
    Language: <i>Python</i>
    <br>
    Likely Mentors: <i>Philipp (phw)</i>
    <br><br>
    <p>
The Tor Project makes use of the Python tool <a
href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/phw/exitmap.git/">Exitmap</a> to
systematically scan for malicious and misbehaving exit relays.  Once such a
relay is found, it is assigned the BadExit flag which prevents clients from
selecting the relay as last hop in their circuit.
    </p>

    <p>
Exitmap supports scanning modules which implement a specific scan over
exit relays.  Examples are the DNS module which checks for DNS poisoning
or the patching check module which looks out for tampered file
downloads.
    </p>

    <p>
This project is meant to extend exitmap in several ways.  First, it
should be made fully autonomous.  That means that exitmap should be able
to run in the background, periodically fetch new relay descriptors, and
have a smart algorithm which keeps scanning all exit relays
periodically.  Second, exitmap should be able to emulate some user
interaction and dynamically "explore" the web in order to detect
tampering.  Third, unit tests should be added for existing and new code
in order to make the code base more robust.

    </p>

    <p>
Proposals should involve a grab-bag of moderately small improvements you'd like
to make. You're encouraged to brainstorm ideas of their own but here's a few to
get ya started...
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bring back the <a href="https://www.atagar.com/arm/images/screenshot_interpretor_full.png">interpreter panel</a>. This panel was dropped when refactoring Nyx, but it would be a neat component to bring back. You can <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/nyx.git/tree/src/cli/interpretorPanel.py?h=release">find old code for it in the history</a> and Stem (the library backing Nyx) has a much improved <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/down_the_rabbit_hole.html">variant of this we can leverage</a>. This task would involve writing the curses code around Stem's interpreter functions.</li>
      <li>Windows support. Like most curses applications Nyx doesn't run natively on Windows. We've had dozens of users request this and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/arm#Windows">it should be possible</a>. This would involve supporting PDCurses and expanding Stem to be able to query the cpu/memory usage of the tor process.</li>
      <li>Unit testing! Nyx has <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/nyx.git/tree/test">started adding tests</a> but it's still very minimal. Achieving any substantial code coverage will require us to figure out how to unit test curses components.</li>
      <li>Onionoo provides additional relay information that could enrich our connection panel such as geoip and rdns. Trick is that at present we can only query it on a per-relay basis which would leak our connections (no-go for security). However, if we could get information about all relays in bulk it would sidestep this. For some old thoughts on this see <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/arm#CircuitDetails">here</a>.</li>
      <li>... and more! Again, don't hesitate to propose ideas of your own.</li>

    <b>Implement and Integrate CONIKS for Tor Messenger</b>
    <br>
    Language: <i>C, JavaScript</i>
    <br>
    Likely Mentors: <i>Marcela, Arlo (arlolra)</i>
    <br><br>
    <p>
CONIKS is an end-user key management and verification system for end-to-end
secure communication services, which improves upon existing key management
systems by providing both strong security and better usability using a model
called key transparency. CONIKS does this by requiring providers to manage
tamper-evident, publicly-auditable key directories, which contain mappings from
usernames to public keys, on behalf of their users. This design makes it easier
for users (both "default" users and power users) to establish trust since they
don't have to worry about or even see keys, but users also don't have to
trust the provider to be well-behaved because the CONIKS client can run as
part of the secure messaging app and automatically check that the service
provider doesn’t map spurious keys to their users' usernames, and it can
verify that observed name-to-key mappings are consistent with what other
clients in the system are seeing. Unlike existing key transparency solutions,
CONIKS also provides strong privacy guarantees by employing cryptographic
primitives for robust data obfuscation.
    </p>

    <p>
The CONIKS system design, protocols, and proof-of-concept are described in
great detail in the <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-melara.pdf">CONIKS
research paper</a>, and basic reference implementations of a CONIKS key server
and a CONIKS client are avialable on <a
href="https://github.com/coniks-sys/coniks-ref-implementation">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
This project has two main components: (1) designing and implementing a CONIKS
key server tailored to Tor Messenger users, and (2) building a CONIKS client
which integrates with the Tor Messenger client. One challenge the applicant
will face is ensuring that the key server design is efficient and scalable for
large volumes of users, concurrent traffic and guarantees this scalability even
as Tor Messenger's user base grows. On the client side, the main challenges
will be to focus on space efficiency as well as minimizing computational
overhead when implementing the CONIKS consistency checks, and determining how
to best communicate CONIKS consistency check results to users in the UI. Since
Tor Messenger does not hand out online identities per se, as most online
communication services do (like, say, Twitter, in which each user has a unique
handle), the CONIKS key server for Tor Messenger will have to map usernames
from third-party communication services to the encryption keys used in Tor
Messenger. One additional important challenge that the applicant will have to
help address is ensuring that each such third-party username remains unique in
the Tor Messenger space and that such external, third-party identities are
indeed controlled by the expected user of that third-party communication
service.
    </p>

    <p>
Some design and implementation questions have been discussed in <a
href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17961">Ticket #17961</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
The applicant should have some familiarity with well-known crypto primitives
and algorithms, as well as have a basic understanding of the key transparency
model. Client side integration will require some basic use of JavaScript.
Consider submitting a patch for <a
href="https://github.com/arlolra/ctypes-otr/issues">one of the open key
verification issues</a> as part of the application process.

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#OtherCoding">Other Coding and Design related ideas</a></h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Tor relays don't work well on Windows XP. On
    Windows, Tor uses the standard <tt>select()</tt> system
    call, which uses space in the non-page pool. This means
    that a medium sized Tor relay will empty the non-page pool, <a
    href="<wiki>doc/WindowsBufferProblems">causing
    havoc and system crashes</a>. We should probably be using overlapped IO
    instead. One solution would be to teach <a
    href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a> how to use
    overlapped IO rather than select() on Windows, and then adapt Tor to
    the new libevent interface. Christian King made a
    <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/libevent-urz/trunk/">good
    start</a> on this in the summer of 2007.</li>

    <li>We need a flexible simulator framework for studying end-to-end
    traffic confirmation attacks. Many researchers have whipped up ad hoc
    simulators to support their intuition either that the attacks work
    really well or that some defense works great. Can we build a simulator
    that's clearly documented and open enough that everybody knows it's
    giving a reasonable answer? This will spur a lot of new research.
    See the entry <a href="#Research">below</a> on confirmation attacks for
    details on the research side of this task &mdash; who knows, when it's
    done maybe you can help write a paper or three also.</li>

    <li>Tor 0.1.1.x and later include support for hardware crypto
    accelerators via OpenSSL. It has been lightly tested and is
    possibly very buggy.  We're looking for more rigorous testing,
    performance analysis, and optimally, code fixes to OpenSSL and
    Tor if needed.</li>

    <li>Write a <a
    href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzzer</a>
    for Tor to discover security vulnerabilities. Determine if there
    are good fuzzing frameworks out there for what we want. Win fame by
    getting credit when we put out a new release because of you!</li>

    <li>Tor uses TCP for transport and TLS for link
    encryption. This is nice and simple, but it means all cells
    on a link are delayed when a single packet gets dropped, and
    it means we can only reasonably support TCP streams. We have a <a
    href="<page docs/faq>#TransportIPnotTCP">list
    of reasons why we haven't shifted to UDP transport</a>, but it would
    be great to see that list get shorter. We also have a proposed <a
    href="<specblob>proposals/100-tor-spec-udp.txt">specification
    for Tor and
    UDP</a> &mdash; please let us know what's wrong with it.</li>

    <li>We're not that far from having IPv6 support for destination addresses
    (at exit nodes). If you care strongly about IPv6, that's probably the
    first place to start.</li>

    <li>We need a way to generate the website diagrams (for example, the "How
    Tor Works" pictures on the <a href="<page about/overview>">overview page</a>
    from source, so we can translate them as UTF-8 text rather than edit
    them by hand with Gimp. We might want to
    integrate this as an wml file so translations are easy and images are
    generated in multiple languages whenever we build the website.</li>

    <li>How can we make the various LiveCD/USB systems easier
    to maintain, improve, and document?  One example is <a
    href="https://tails.boum.org/">The Amnesic Incognito Live
    System</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
    Another anti-censorship project is to try to make Tor
    more scanning-resistant.  Right now, an adversary can identify <a
    href="<specblob>proposals/125-bridges.txt">Tor bridges</a>
    just by trying to connect to them, following the Tor protocol,
    and seeing if they respond.  To solve this, bridges could <a
    href="<svnprojects>design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc9.3">act like
    webservers</a> (HTTP or HTTPS) when contacted by port-scanning tools,
    and not act like bridges until the user provides a bridge-specific key.
    To start, check out Shane Pope's <a
    href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37735/index.html">thesis and prototype</a>.

    <a id="Research"></a>
    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#Research">Research</a></h2>
    <ol>
    <li>The "end-to-end traffic confirmation attack":
    by watching traffic at Alice and at Bob, we can <a
    href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#danezis:pet2004">compare
    traffic signatures and become convinced that we're watching the same
    stream</a>. So far Tor accepts this as a fact of life and assumes this
    attack is trivial in all cases. First of all, is that actually true? How
    much traffic of what sort of distribution is needed before the adversary
    is confident he has won? Are there scenarios (e.g. not transmitting much)
    that slow down the attack? Do some traffic padding or traffic shaping
    schemes work better than others?</li>
    <li>A related question is: Does running a relay/bridge provide additional
    protection against these timing attacks? Can an external adversary that can't
    see inside TLS links still recognize individual streams reliably?
    Does the amount of traffic carried degrade this ability any? What if the
    client-relay deliberately delayed upstream relayed traffic to create a queue
    that could be used to mimic timings of client downstream traffic to make it
    look like it was also relayed? This same queue could also be used for masking
    timings in client upstream traffic with the techniques from <a
    href="http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/#ShWa-Timing06">adaptive padding</a>,
    but without the need for additional traffic. Would such an interleaving of
    client upstream traffic obscure timings for external adversaries? Would the
    strategies need to be adjusted for asymmetric links? For example, on
    asymmetric links, is it actually possible to differentiate client traffic from
    natural bursts due to their asymmetric capacity? Or is it easier than
    symmetric links for some other reason?</li>
    <li>Repeat Murdoch and Danezis's <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/projects/anon/#torta">attack from
    Oakland 05</a> on the current Tor network. See if you can learn why it
    works well on some nodes and not well on others. (My theory is that the
    fast nodes with spare capacity resist the attack better.) If that's true,
    then experiment with the RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst
    options to run a relay that is used as a client while relaying the
    attacker's traffic: as we crank down the RelayBandwidthRate, does the
    attack get harder? What's the right ratio of RelayBandwidthRate to
    actually capacity? Or is it a ratio at all? While we're at it, does a
    much larger set of candidate relays increase the false positive rate
    or other complexity for the attack? (The Tor network is now almost two
    orders of magnitude larger than it was when they wrote their paper.) Be
    sure to read <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#clog-the-queue">Don't
    Clog the Queue</a> too.</li>
    <li>The "routing zones attack": most of the literature thinks of
    the network path between Alice and her entry node (and between the
    exit node and Bob) as a single link on some graph. In practice,
    though, the path traverses many autonomous systems (ASes), and <a
    href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#feamster:wpes2004">it's not uncommon
    that the same AS appears on both the entry path and the exit path</a>.
    Unfortunately, to accurately predict whether a given Alice, entry,
    exit, Bob quad will be dangerous, we need to download an entire Internet
    routing zone and perform expensive operations on it. Are there practical
    approximations, such as avoiding IP addresses in the same /8 network?</li>
    <li>Other research questions regarding geographic diversity consider
    the tradeoff between choosing an efficient circuit and choosing a random
    circuit. Look at Stephen Rollyson's <a
    href="http://swiki.cc.gatech.edu:8080/ugResearch/uploads/7/ImprovingTor.pdf">position
    paper</a> on how to discard particularly slow choices without hurting
    anonymity "too much". This line of reasoning needs more work and more
    thinking, but it looks very promising.</li>
    <li>Tor doesn't work very well when relays have asymmetric bandwidth
    (e.g. cable or DSL). Because Tor has separate TCP connections between
    each hop, if the incoming bytes are arriving just fine and the outgoing
    bytes are all getting dropped on the floor, the TCP push-back mechanisms
    don't really transmit this information back to the incoming streams.
    Perhaps Tor should detect when it's dropping a lot of outgoing packets,
    and rate-limit incoming streams to regulate this itself? I can imagine
    a build-up and drop-off scheme where we pick a conservative rate-limit,
    slowly increase it until we get lost packets, back off, repeat. We
    need somebody who's good with networks to simulate this and help design
    solutions; and/or we need to understand the extent of the performance
    degradation, and use this as motivation to reconsider UDP transport.</li>
    <li>A related topic is congestion control. Is our
    current design sufficient once we have heavy use? Maybe
    we should experiment with variable-sized windows rather
    than fixed-size windows? That seemed to go well in an <a
    href="http://www.psc.edu/index.php/hpn-ssh/638">ssh
    throughput experiment</a>. We'll need to measure and tweak, and maybe
    overhaul if the results are good.</li>
    <li>Our censorship-resistance goals include preventing
    an attacker who's looking at Tor traffic on the wire from <a
    href="<svnprojects>design-paper/blocking.html#sec:network-fingerprint">distinguishing
    it from normal SSL traffic</a>. Obviously we can't achieve perfect
    steganography and still remain usable, but for a first step we'd like to
    block any attacks that can win by observing only a few packets. One of
    the remaining attacks we haven't examined much is that Tor cells are 512
    bytes, so the traffic on the wire may well be a multiple of 512 bytes.
    How much does the batching and overhead in TLS records blur this on the
    wire? Do different buffer flushing strategies in Tor affect this? Could
    a bit of padding help a lot, or is this an attack we must accept?</li>
    <li>Tor circuits are built one hop at a time, so in theory we have the
    ability to make some streams exit from the second hop, some from the
    third, and so on. This seems nice because it breaks up the set of exiting
    streams that a given relay can see. But if we want each stream to be safe,
    the "shortest" path should be at least 3 hops long by our current logic, so
    the rest will be even longer. We need to examine this performance / security
    tradeoff.</li>
    <li>It's not that hard to DoS Tor relays or directory authorities. Are client
    puzzles the right answer? What other practical approaches are there? Bonus
    if they're backward-compatible with the current Tor protocol.</li>
    <li>Programs like <a
    href="<page docs/torbutton/index>">Torbutton</a> aim to hide
    your browser's UserAgent string by replacing it with a uniform answer for
    every Tor user. That way the attacker can't splinter Tor's anonymity set
    by looking at that header. It tries to pick a string that is commonly used
    by non-Tor users too, so it doesn't stand out. Question one: how badly
    do we hurt ourselves by periodically updating the version of Firefox
    that Torbutton claims to be? If we update it too often, we splinter the
    anonymity sets ourselves. If we don't update it often enough, then all the
    Tor users stand out because they claim to be running a quite old version
    of Firefox. The answer here probably depends on the Firefox versions seen
    in the wild. Question two: periodically people ask us to cycle through N
    UserAgent strings rather than stick with one. Does this approach help,
    hurt, or not matter? Consider: cookies and recognizing Torbutton users
    by their rotating UserAgents; malicious websites who only attack certain
    browsers; and whether the answers to question one impact this answer.
    </li>
    <li>How many bridge relays do you need to know to maintain
    reachability? We should measure the churn in our bridges. If there is
    lots of churn, are there ways to keep bridge users more likely to stay
    connected?
