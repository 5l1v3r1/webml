00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.780
We've gotten very used to the Internet.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.700
We are constantly sharing information
about ourselves and our private lives:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.960
food we eat, people we meet,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.480
places we go, and the stuff we read.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.640
Let me explain it better.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.740
Right at this moment,
if someone attempts to look you up,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.480
they'll see your real identity,
precise location, operating system,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.500
all the sites you've visited,
the browser you use to surf the web,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.140
and so much more information
about you and your life

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.460
which you probably didn't mean
to share with unknown strangers,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.840
who could easily use this data
to exploit you.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.120
But not if you're using Tor!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.840
Tor Browser protects our privacy
and identity on the Internet.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.760
Tor secures your connection
with three layers of encryption

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.760
and passes it through three voluntarily
operated servers around the world,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.520
which enables us to communicate
anonymously over the Internet.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.280
Tor also protects our data

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.900
against corporate or government targeted
and mass surveillance.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.340
Perhaps you live in a repressive country
which tries to control and surveil the Internet.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.800
Or perhaps you don't want big corporations
taking advantage of your personal information.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.640
Tor makes all of its users
to look the same

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.800
which confuses the observer
and makes you anonymous.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.980
So, the more people use the Tor network,
the stronger it gets

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.800
as it's easier to hide in a crowd
of people who look exactly the same.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.240
You can bypass the censorship
without being worried about

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.100
the censor knowing what you do
on the Internet.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.440
The ads won't follow you
everywhere for months,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.300
starting when you first
clicked on a product.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.380
By using Tor, the sites you visit
won't even know who you are,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.760
from what part of the world
you're visiting them,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
unless you login and tell them so.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.840
By downloading and using Tor,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560
you can protect the people
who need anonymity,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.640
like activists, journalists and bloggers.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Download and use Tor! Or run a relay!
