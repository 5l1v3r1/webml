<h1>The Tor Project is looking for a pluggable transport developer!</h1>

<p>
This job is for the development and maintenance of the
<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">flash proxy</a>
circumvention system, with a focus on deployment and getting tools in
the hands of users. If it goes well, we might have you branch out into
improving usability and deployability of other Tor pluggable transports.
</p>

<p>
Applicants must be familiar with Python, JavaScript, and web
technologies, particularly WebSocket. You will do usability testing and
be in charge of producing binary packages of client software for
GNU/Linux, Windows, and OS X. The system's supporting infrastructure is
already in place, but may require changes depending on the future
development of the client programs. There also is the potential for the
development and implementation of new covert rendezvous methods that may
have broader use outside the flash proxy system.
</p>

<p>
You will be assisted and mentored by David Fifield, the primary
developer of the flash proxy software and co-author of its
<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/flashproxy.pdf">research
paper</a>, and all-around good guy.
</p>

<p>
This link will display open flash proxy tickets, giving an idea of the
tasks we want done.

Flashproxy tickets</a>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
All candidates must:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Know Python and JavaScript. At least two years of experience, or less if
you have a few years' experience with other programming languages.
</li>

<li>
Have experience in packaging software. In particular, it is likely that
you will need to use py2exe to make Windows packages, and you should
know how to use makefiles.
</li>

<li>
Be self-directed: The best candidates can solve problems on their own
but also know when to ask for help. Communication with other developers
will happen over email, instant messaging, and IRC.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
An ideal candidate would also:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Know about Tor
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en">pluggable
transports</a> and their
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt">specification</a>.
</li>

<li>
Have run the
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/flashproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/README">sample
commands in the README</a>, and made notes about the process. One of
your early tasks will be to do such testing so that the packages you
make will be effectively usable.
</li>

<li>
Have an idea of real-world censorship regimes and the threat model faced
by circumvention tools.
</li>

<li>
Have basic familiarity with distributed version control systems.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Other notes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tor developers don't have an office; you can work from
	wherever you want, in basically any country. You'll need to be
	comfortable in this environment! We coordinate via IRC, email,
	and bug trackers.</li>
	<li>Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have
	the right experience.</li>
	<li>We only write free and open source software, and we don't
	believe in software patents.</li>
</ul>

<p>
How to apply:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Link to a sample of code you've written in the past that
	you're allowed to show us.</li>
	<li>Provide a CV explaining your background, experience, skills,
	and other relevant qualifications.</li>
	<li>List some people who can tell us more about you: these
	references could be employers or coworkers, open source projects,
	etc.</li>
	<li>Email the above to jobs at torproject.org, specifying the
	"flash proxy" position.</li>
</ul>

About the company:<br>
 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
 network's 3000 volunteer relays carry 16 Gbps for upwards of half a
 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 14 paid developers, researchers, and
 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
 in part by individual and corporate donations.
