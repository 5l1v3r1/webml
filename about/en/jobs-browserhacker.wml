<h1>The Tor Project is looking for a Browser Hacker!</h1>

<p>
Your job would be to work on Torbutton and patches to our
Firefox-based browser, as well as a potential Android port. This would
be a contractor position likely starting in October and going through
Q1 2013, with the possibility of later in 2013 and beyond. There may
also be a possibility for part-time work prior to October.
</p>

<p>
All candidates must:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Have experience in C++ and ideally Javascript. At least 5 years
experience is probably necessary for the level of expertise we want,
though some of these years can be replaced with other Object Oriented
Programming and/or C experience. If you meet this level of experience
with C++/OOP, Javascript can be learned on the job.</li>

<li>Have a solid understanding of issues surrounding secure C++
programming (at least to the level of avoiding them).</li>

<li>Be comfortable and experienced with repeatedly diving into new,
unfamiliar codebases, looking for ways to alter and augment their
functionality in specific, goal-oriented ways.</li>

<li>Be at least passingly familiar with web technologies and how the
web works, especially the same-origin model and web tracking.</li>

<li>Be comfortable and experienced justifying and documenting technical
decisions for a public, world-wide technical audience.</li>

<li>Be comfortable working remotely.</li>

<li>Be comfortable and experienced with interacting with users and other
developers online. Have thick enough skin to survive occasional trolling
from either group.</li>

<li>Be comfortable with transparency: as a non-profit, everything we do is in
public, including your name (or at least your business name) and pay
rate.</li>

</ul>

<p>
An ideal candidate would also:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Already be familiar with writing addons for Mozilla Firefox or other
web browsers.</li>

<li>Already be familiar with writing patches for Mozilla Firefox or
other web browsers.</li>

<li>Already be familiar with compiling software for the Android
platform.</li>

<li>Be capable of insanely creative yet also ruthlessly pragmatic
thinking.</li>

<li>Be familiar with probability, statistics, and information theory.</li>

<li>Know enough about networking to be able to visualize what HTTP
1.1 looks like on the wire while encapsulated within Tor's network
protocol.</li>

<li>Have experience with open-source software development, including
working with distributed teams across different time-zones containing
employees and volunteers of differing skill levels over multiple mediums,
including email, instant messaging, and IRC.</li>

<li>Have basic familiarity with distributed version control systems.</li>

<li>Have contributed significant chunks of code to multiple open-source
projects in the past.</li>

<li>Genuinely be excited about Tor and our values.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Detailed job description:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Being a Tor Browser Hacker includes triaging, diagnosing, and fixing
bugs; looking for and resolving web privacy issues; responding on short
notice to security issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers
and volunteers on implementing new features and web behavior changes.
</p>

<p>
We'd also need help making our code more maintainable, testable,
and mergeable by upstream. Sometimes, we need to drop everything and
scramble to implement last-minute fixes, or to deploy urgent security
updates. You'd also be reviewing other people's code, designs, and
academic research papers, and looking for ways to improve upon them.
</p>

<p>
For an even more detailed overview of the full breadth
and depth of the work you'd be doing, have a look at <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/">The
Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser</a>, especially <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#DesignRequirements">The
Design Requirements</a> section.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Other notes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tor developers don't have an office; you can work from
	wherever you want, in basically any country. You'll need to be
	comfortable in this environment! We coordinate via IRC, email,
	and bug trackers.</li>
	<li>Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have
	the right experience.</li>
	<li>We only write free and open source software, and we don't
	believe in software patents.</li>
</ul>

<p>
How to apply:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Link to a sample of code you've written in the past that
	you're allowed to show us.</li>
	<li>Provide a CV explaining your background, experience, skills,
	and other relevant qualifications.</li>
	<li>List some people who can tell us more about you: these
	references could be employers or coworkers, open source projects,
	etc.</li>
	<li>Email the above to jobs at torproject.org, specifying the
	"Browser Hacker" position.</li>
</ul>

About the company:<br>
 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
 network's 3000 volunteer relays carry 16 Gbps for upwards of half a
 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 14 paid developers, researchers, and
 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
 in part by individual and corporate donations.
