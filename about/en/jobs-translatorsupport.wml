About the company:<br>
 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
 network's 3000 volunteer relays carry 16 Gbps for upwards of half a
 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 14 paid developers, researchers, and
 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
 in part by individual and corporate donations.
