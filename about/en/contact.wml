    <h2>Tor: Contact</h2>

    <p>First, if you have a problem or question about using Tor, go look at the <a href="<page docs/documentation>#Support">Support section</a> for how to proceed. The Tor developers spend most of their time developing Tor, and there are no people devoted to user support, so try to help yourself before <a href="<page docs/faq>#SupportMail">politely trying to find a volunteer</a>.</p>

    <p>If you really do need to reach us, here are some approaches. All
    of these addresses are @lists.torproject.org. Please be patient and <a
    href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">helpful</a>,
    and please make sure to write your mail in English.</p>

    <i>tor-assistants</i> is the catch-all address for everything. It can be
    used for:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Contacting the people who manage the directory authorities. Use
      this if you run a Tor relay and have a question or problem with
      your relay.</li>
      <li>So we can fix typos on the website, change wrong statements or
      directions on the website, and add new sections and paragraphs that
      you send us. You might want to make a draft of your new sections
      on <a href="<wiki>">the Tor wiki</a> first.</li>
      <li>Hearing about your documents, patches, testing, experiences
      with supporting applications, and so forth inspired by our <a
      href="<page getinvolved/volunteer>">volunteer page</a> (or other
      problems you've fixed or documented about using Tor). There's no
      need to mail us before you start working on something -- like all
      volunteer Internet projects, we hear from a lot of excited people
      who vanish soon after, so we are most interested in hearing about
      actual progress.</li>
    </ul>
    
    A few other addresses are more specific:
    
    <ul>
      <li><i>tor-translation</i> can put new <a href="<page
      getinvolved/translation>">website translations</a> into place,
      and help answer questions about existing and new translations.</li>
      <li><i>tordnsel</i> is the alias for the people responsible for
      the tordns exitlist.</li>
      <li><i>donations</i> is for questions and comments about <a
      href="<page donate/donate>">getting money to the developers</a>. More
      donations means <a href="<page docs/faq>#Funding">more
      Tor</a>. We're happy to help think about creative ways for you
      to contribute.</li>
      <li><i>execdir</i> is for press/media, questions and comments about
      Tor the non-profit corporation: trademark questions, affiliation
      and coordination, major gifts, contract inquiries, licensing and
      certification, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <a id="irc"></a>
    Tor users and developers can also be found in the following channels on <a
    href="http://www.oftc.net/oftc/">oftc</a>:
    
    <ul>
      <li><i>#tor</i> - User and relay operation discussions. Having trouble
      running Tor or a question for other Tor users? Then this is the spot for
      you.</li>
      <li><i>#tor-dev</i> - Channel for people who want to do development.
      Discussions about Tor related coding, protocols, and <a href="<page
      getinvolved/volunteer>">project ideas</a> are all welcome.</li>
      <li><i>#nottor</i> - This is where Tor people hang out to talk about
      stuff that is not related to Tor.</li>
    </ul>
