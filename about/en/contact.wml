    <h2>Tor: Contact</h2>

    <p>First, if you have a problem or question about using Tor, go look at the <a href="<page docs/documentation>#Support">Support section</a> for how to proceed. The Tor developers spend most of their time developing Tor, and there are no people devoted to user support, so try to help yourself before <a href="<page docs/faq>#SupportMail">politely trying to find a volunteer</a>.</p>

    <p>If you really do need to reach us, here are some approaches. All
    of these addresses are @torproject.org. Note that in practice most of
    them go to the same small group of people, so please be patient and <a
    href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">helpful</a>,
    and please make sure to write your mail in English.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>tor-assistants</i> is the catch-all address for
      everything. If you'd like to ask a more directed question, please
      see the descriptions below.</li>
      <li><i>tor-ops</i> gets to the people who manage the directory
      authorities. Use this if you run a Tor relay and have a question
      or problem with your relay.</li>
      <li><i>tor-webmaster</i> can fix typos on the website, change wrong
      statements or directions on the website, and add new sections and
      paragraphs that you send us. You might want to make a draft of
      your new sections on <a href="<wiki>">the Tor wiki</a> first.</li>
      <li><i>tor-volunteer</i> wants to hear about your
      documents, patches, testing, experiences with supporting
      applications, and so forth inspired by our <a href="<page
      getinvolved/volunteer>">volunteer page</a> (or other problems
      you've fixed or documented about using Tor). There's no need
      to mail us before you start working on something -- like all
      volunteer Internet projects, we hear from a lot of excited people
      who vanish soon after, so we are most interested in hearing about
      actual progress.</li>
      <li><i>tor-translation</i> can put new <a href="<page
      getinvolved/translation>">website translations</a> into place,
      and help answer questions about existing and new translations.</li>
      <li><i>tordnsel</i> is the alias for the people responsible for
      the tordns exitlist.</li>
      <li><i>donations</i> is for questions and comments about <a
      href="<page donate/donate>">getting money to the developers</a>. More
      donations means <a href="<page docs/faq>#Funding">more
      Tor</a>. We're happy to help think about creative ways for you
      to contribute.</li>
      <li><i>execdir</i> is for press/media, questions and comments about
      Tor the non-profit corporation: trademark questions, affiliation
      and coordination, major gifts, contract inquiries, licensing and
      certification, etc.</li>
