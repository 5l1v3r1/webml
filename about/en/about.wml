    <h1>Tor Overview</h1>
    <p>Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to
improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software
developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor
provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and
individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their
privacy.</p>
    <p>Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family
members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, and the like
when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's <a
href="<page docs/hidden-services>">hidden services</a> let users publish web sites and other services
without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for
socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse
survivors, or people with illnesses.</p>
    <p>Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and
dissidents. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their workers
to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country, without
notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization.</p>
    <p>Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members'
online privacy and security. Activist groups like the <a
href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) recommend
Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. Corporations use Tor
as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to protect sensitive
procurement patterns from eavesdroppers. They also use it to replace traditional
VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of communication. Which locations
have employees working late? Which locations have employees consulting
job-hunting websites? Which research divisions are communicating with the
company's patent lawyers?</p>
    <p>A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence
gathering, and one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East
recently. Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without
leaving government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting
operations.</p>
    <p>The <a href="<page about/corepeople>">variety of people</a> who use Tor
is actually part of <a href="<page about/overview>">what makes it so secure</a>.
Tor hides you among the other users on the network, so the more populous and
diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected.</p>
