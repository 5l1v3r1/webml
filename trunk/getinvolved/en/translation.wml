    <p>
    If you want to help translate the Tor tools and documentation into
    other languages, here are some guidelines to help you do this as
    efficiently as possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you would like to help translate other Tor project related information,
    please visit our <a href="<page getinvolved/translation-overview>">Translation Overview</a>
    for a clear overview of what needs translation help. If you're stuck, please
    contact us via email: <tt>tor-translation AT torproject.org</tt>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note that even if you can't translate many pages for your language,
    a few pages will still be helpful.
    Also, rather than just translating each page word
    by word, please try to translate the ideas so they make the most sense
    in your language.</p>
