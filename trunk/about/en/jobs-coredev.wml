<h1>The Tor Project is looking for another dedicated core developer!</h1>
<h1>Note: we've filled this position for now, but we hope to be looking
for another core developer in the future.</h1>

<p>
Your job would be to work on all aspects of the main Tor network daemon
and other open-source software.

This would be a contractor position starting in 2013 (with plenty of
work to keep you busy), with the possibility of 2014 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
Any candidate must:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Have extensive experience in C, and several other programming
	languages. At least 5 years experience with C is probably
	necessary for the level of expertise we want; most people would
	need more.</li>
	<li>Have a solid understanding of issues surrounding secure
	C programming.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable working remotely.</li>
	<li>Be familiar and experienced with nonblocking, event-driven
	networking programs.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable and experienced with interacting with users online.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable and experienced with driving the entire
	lifecycle of a new feature in an existing piece of software,
	from design to implementation to testing.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable and experienced getting code and design
	reviewed, and reviewing the code and design of others.</li>
	<li>Be comfortable with transparency: as a non-profit, everything
	we do is in public, including your name and pay rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
An ideal candidate would also:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Know enough of the basics of cryptography in order to
	understand how to implement our protocols and discuss changes
	to them. (Actually implementing block ciphers and stuff like
	that isn't necessary.)</li>
	<li>Know enough about networking in order to understand how to
	implement our protocols and discuss changes to them.</li>
	<li>Have experience with high-performance networking code.</li>
	<li>Have experience with open-source software development,
	including working with distributed teams across different
	time-zones containing employees and volunteers of differing
	skill levels over email and IRC.</li>
	<li>Have basic familiarity with distributed version control
	systems.</li>
	<li>Have contributed significant chunks of code to multiple
	open-source projects in the past.</li>
	<li>Genuinely be excited about Tor and our values.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Being a core Tor developer includes triaging, diagnosing, and
fixing bugs; looking for and resolving security issues; and working
collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on implementing
new features and protocol changes at every stage from design to
maintenance. We'd also need help making our code more scalable,
testable, and maintainable. Sometimes, we need to drop everything
and scramble to implement last-minute anticensorship schemes, or to
deploy urgent security updates. You'd also be reviewing other people's
code and designs, and looking for ways to improve it. For an idea of
the breadth and depth of the work you'd be doing, have a look at <a
href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/ChangeLog">the
ChangeLog file from the Tor source distribution</a>.
</p>

<p>
Other notes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You'll need to be comfortable in this environment! We
	coordinate via IRC, instant messaging, email, and bug
	trackers.</li>
	<li>Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have
	the right experience.</li>
	<li>We only write free and open source software, and we don't
	believe in software patents.</li>
</ul>

<p>
How to apply:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Link to a sample of code you've written in the past that
	you're allowed to show us.</li>
	<li>Provide a CV explaining your background, experience, skills,
	and other relevant qualifications.</li>
	<li>List some people who can tell us more about you: these
	references could be employers or coworkers, open source projects,
	etc.</li>
	<li>Email the above to jobs at torproject.org.</li>
</ul>

About the company:<br>
 The Tor Project is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to research,
 development, and education about online anonymity and privacy. The Tor
 network's 3000 volunteer relays carry 16 Gbps for upwards of half a
 million daily users, including ordinary citizens who want protection
 from identity theft and prying corporations, corporations who want
 to look at a competitor's website in private, people around the world
 whose Internet connections are censored, and even governments and law
 enforcement. Tor has a staff of 14 paid developers, researchers, and
 advocates, plus many dozen volunteers who help out on a daily basis. Tor
 is funded in part by government research and development grants, and
 in part by individual and corporate donations.
