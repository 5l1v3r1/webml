# This script will convert all of the English wml files in
# https://svn.torproject.org/svn/website/trunk/ to pot files, and
# keep them updated. The script will also convert subdirectories that
# exist in the website module.
#
# For more information, see the HOWTO and README in
# translation/tools/gsoc09.

# for example "The Tor Project, Inc"

# A lot of the wml files have custom tags. These tags have been defined
# in website/include/versions.wmi. Tags that people usually forget to close,
# as well as tags that are not defined in versions.wmi, have been added.
# See: https://svn.torproject.org/svn/website/trunk/include/versions.wmi

# of tags that the module should not try to set by default in any
# category. For now, we only need the input tag.
