    <p>Tor's tools and technologies are already used by millions 
    of people to protect their activities online.  These
    users include journalists and human rights workers in politically
    rigid countries communicating with whistleblowers and dissidents.
    Law enforcement officers on Internet sting operations stay
    anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post socially
    sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors
    and those with illnesses. Â The Tor network also provides
    protection for people looking for another layer of privacy from
    the millions of websites and ISPs bent on collecting private
    information and tracking their moves online.</p>
    
    <p>Tor welcomes your support through purchasing of Tor branded items and
    through the consistent donations of thousands of individuals through our
    <a href="<page donate/donate>">various methods of donation</a>.  </p>
    
    <h2>ABOUT THE TOR PROJECT</h2>
    
    <p>Based in Walpole, MA, The Tor Project
    develops free and open-source software that provides online
    anonymity to the everyday Internet user. Tor was born out of a
    collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research Lab starting in 2001,
    and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2006. The
    Tor Project now works with many individuals, NGOs, law
    enforcement agencies, and businesses globally to help them
    protect their anonymity online.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor
    anonymity software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also
    helps to lead the research community in understanding how to
    build and measure scalable and secure anonymity networks. The Tor
    developers publish several new research papers each year in major
    academic security conferences, and just about every major
    security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper.  Tor is a
    project-funded organization with eight full-time staff.</p>
