<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>

<h2><strong>TOR PROJECT RELEASES CIRCUMVENTION TOOL ARTICLE</strong></h2>

<p><strong>WALPOLE, MA</strong> The Tor Project releases an article about
the <a href="/presskit/2010-09-16-circumvention-features.pdf">"Ten
Things to Look for in a Circumvention Tool"</a>. As more countries
crack down on Internet use, people around the world are turning to
anti-censorship software that lets them reach blocked websites. Many
types of software, also known as circumvention tools, have been created
to answer the threat to freedom online. These tools provide different
features and levels of security, and it's important for users to
understand the tradeoffs.</p>
  
<p>This article lays out ten features you should consider when evaluating
a circumvention tool. The goal isn't to advocate for any specific
tool, but to point out what kind of tools are useful for different
situations.</p>

<p>Tor's tools and technologies are already used by millions of people
to protect their activities online.  These users include journalists and
human rights workers in politically rigid countries communicating with
whistleblowers and dissidents.  Law enforcement officers on Internet
sting operations stay anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post
socially sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors
and those with illnesses. Â The Tor network also provides protection
for people looking for another layer of privacy from the millions of
websites and ISPs bent on collecting private information and tracking
their moves online.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE TOR PROJECT</h2>

<p>Based in Walpole, MA, The Tor Project develops free and open-source
software that provides online anonymity to the everyday Internet
user. Tor was born out of a collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research
Lab starting in 2001, and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit
in 2006. The Tor Project now works with many individuals, NGOs, law
enforcement agencies, and businesses globally to help them protect their
anonymity online.</p>

<p>In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor anonymity
software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also helps to lead the
research community in understanding how to build and measure scalable and
secure anonymity networks. The Tor developers publish several new research
papers each year in major academic security conferences, and just about
every major security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper.
Tor is a project-funded organization with a staff of 15.</p>
