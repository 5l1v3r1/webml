    <h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>
    
    <h2><strong>THE TOR PROJECT ANNOUNCES THREE-YEAR DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP</strong></h2>
    
    <p><strong>DEDHAM, MA</strong> - The Tor Project has published its <a
    href="../press/presskit/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf">three year
    development roadmap</a>, focused on providing anti-censorship tools and
    services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed
    societies.</p>
    
    <p>Tor's tools and technologies are already used by hundreds of
    thousands of people to protect their activities online.  These
    users include journalists and human rights workers in politically
    rigid countries communicating with whistleblowers and dissidents.
    Law enforcement officers on Internet sting operations stay
    anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post socially
    sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors
    and those with illnesses.  The Tor network also provides
    protection for people looking for another layer of privacy from
    the millions of websites and ISPs bent on collecting private
    information and tracking their moves online.</p>
    
    <p>While Tor's original goal was to provide this important
    anonymity, many people around the world use Tor to get around
    Internet censorship, as well.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human
    Rights Watch</a> and <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">Global
    Voices Online</a> have both recommended Tor as a tool to circumvent
    censorship regimes in oppressive nations. The roadmap is focused
    on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the
    advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies.</p>
    
    <p>"If your Internet provider can't see what sites you're looking
    at, that also means they can't prevent you from reaching sites
    they don't want you to see," said Roger Dingledine, Tor Project
    Leader.  "This new roadmap with support from the larger community
    will let us make Tor even better at fighting censorship.  With
    three years of funding, we can tackle larger problems than
    before, and we can focus on making sure that Tor can grow to
    handle all the people who want to use it."</p>
    
    <p>Tor welcomes additional sponsors to join <a
    href="https://www.torproject.org/sponsors">current sponsors</a>;
    such as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the NLnet Foundation,
    and hundreds of individual donors. While existing funders are enough to
    get the items on the roadmap started, an additional $2.1 million over the
    next three years will turn the roadmap into usable tools.</p>
    
    <h2>ABOUT THE TOR PROJECT</h2>
    
    <p>Based in Dedham, MA, The Tor Project
    develops free and open-source software that provides online
    anonymity to the everyday Internet user. Tor was born out of a
    collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research Lab starting in 2001,
    and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2006. The
    Tor Project now works with many individuals, NGOs, law
    enforcement agencies, and businesses globally to help them
    protect their anonymity online.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor
    anonymity software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also
    helps to lead the research community in understanding how to
    build and measure scalable and secure anonymity networks. The Tor
    developers publish several new research papers each year in major
    academic security conferences, and just about every major
    security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper.</p>
