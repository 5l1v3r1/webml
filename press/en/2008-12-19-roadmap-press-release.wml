<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>
</br>
<h2><strong>THE TOR PROJECT ANNOUNCES THREE-YEAR DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP</strong></h2>
</br>
<p><strong>DEDHAM, MA</strong> - The Tor Project has published its <a
href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf">three year
development roadmap</a>, focused on providing anti-censorship tools and
services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed
societies.</p>

<p>Tor's tools and technologies are already used by hundreds of 
thousands of people to protect their activities online.  These 
users include journalists and human rights workers in politically 
rigid countries communicating with whistleblowers and dissidents. 
Law enforcement officers on Internet sting operations stay 
anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post socially 
sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors 
and those with illnesses.  The Tor network also provides 
protection for people looking for another layer of privacy from 
the millions of websites and ISPs bent on collecting private 
information and tracking their moves online.</p>

<p>While Tor's original goal was to provide this important 
anonymity, many people around the world use Tor to get around 
Internet censorship, as well.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human
Rights Watch</a> and <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">Global 
Voices Online</a> have both recommended Tor as a tool to circumvent 
censorship regimes in oppressive nations. The roadmap is focused 
on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the 
advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies.</p>

<p>"If your Internet provider can't see what sites you're looking 
at, that also means they can't prevent you from reaching sites 
they don't want you to see," said Roger Dingledine, Tor Project 
Leader.  "This new roadmap with support from the larger community 
will let us make Tor even better at fighting censorship.  With 
three years of funding, we can tackle larger problems than 
before, and we can focus on making sure that Tor can grow to 
handle all the people who want to use it."</p>

<p>Tor welcomes additional sponsors to join <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/sponsors">current sponsors</a>; 
such as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the NLnet Foundation,
and hundreds of individual donors. While existing funders are enough to
get the items on the roadmap started, an additional $2.1 million over the
next three years will turn the roadmap into usable tools.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE TOR PROJECT</h2>
</br>
<p>Based in Dedham, MA, The Tor Project 
develops free and open-source software that provides online 
anonymity to the everyday Internet user. Tor was born out of a 
collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research Lab starting in 2001, 
and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2006. The 
Tor Project now works with many individuals, NGOs, law 
enforcement agencies, and businesses globally to help them 
protect their anonymity online.</p>

<p>In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor 
anonymity software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also 
helps to lead the research community in understanding how to 
build and measure scalable and secure anonymity networks. The Tor 
developers publish several new research papers each year in major 
academic security conferences, and just about every major 
security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper.</p>
