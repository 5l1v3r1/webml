<h2><a class="anchor" href="#Warning">Warning: Want Tor to really
work?</a></h2>

# Translators: you might not want to translate this section quite
# yet, since it's likely to change a lot before we like it. -RD

<p>...then please don't just install it and go on.  You need to change
some of your habits, and reconfigure your software!
Tor by itself is <b>NOT</b> all you need to maintain your anonymity.
There are several major pitfalls to watch out for.
</p>

<p>First, Tor only protects Internet applications that are configured to
send their traffic through Tor &mdash; it doesn't magically anonymize
all your traffic just because you install it.  We recommend you
use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> with the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275/">Torbutton</a> extension.
<!-- , and follow <a href="comingsoon">other recommendations for other
supported applications</a>. -->
</p>

<p>Second, browser plugins such as Java, Flash, ActiveX, RealPlayer,
Quicktime, Adobe's PDF plugin, and others can be manipulated
into revealing your IP address. You should probably uninstall your plugins
(go to "about:plugins" to see what is installed), or investigate <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1237/">QuickJava</a>, <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/433/">FlashBlock</a>, and
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/722/">NoScript</a>
if you really need them. Consider removing extensions that look up
more information about the websites you type in (like Google toolbar),
as they may bypass Tor and/or broadcast sensitive information. Some
people prefer using two browsers (one for Tor, one for unsafe browsing).
<!-- You may even want to use a text browser, such as <a
href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a> when you are using Tor. -->
<!-- You may also find
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/722/">NoScript</a> and <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/">AdBlock</a> helpful. -->
</p>

<p>Third, beware of cookies: if you ever browse without Tor and Privoxy
and a site gives you a cookie, that cookie could identify you even when
you start using Tor again. You should clear your cookies frequently. <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/82/">CookieCuller</a> can help
protect any cookies you do not want to lose.
</p>

<p>Fourth, Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic,
and it encrypts everything inside the Tor network, but <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ExitEavesdroppers">it
can't encrypt your traffic between the Tor network and its final
destination.</a>
If you are communicating sensitive information, you should use as much
care as you would on the normal scary Internet &mdash; use SSL or other
end-to-end encryption and authentication.
</p>

<p>Fifth, while Tor blocks attackers
on your local network from discovering or influencing your destination,
it opens new risks: malicious or misconfigured Tor exit nodes can send
you the wrong page, or even send you embedded Java applets disguised as
domains you trust.
</p>

<p>Be smart and learn more. Understand what Tor does and does not offer.
This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your
help <a href="<page volunteer>#Documentation">identifying and documenting
all the issues</a>.
