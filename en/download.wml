<a id="Warning"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#Warning">Warning: Want Tor to really
work?</a></h2>

<p>...then please don't just install it and go on.  You need to change
some of your habits, and reconfigure your software!
Tor by itself is <b>NOT</b> all you need to maintain your anonymity.
There are several major pitfalls to watch out for:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Tor only protects Internet applications that are configured to
send their traffic through Tor &mdash; it doesn't magically anonymize
all your traffic just because you install it.  We recommend you
use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> with the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2275/">Torbutton</a> extension.
</li>

<li>Browser plugins such as Java, Flash, ActiveX, RealPlayer,
Quicktime, Adobe's PDF plugin, and others can be manipulated
into revealing your IP address. You should probably uninstall your plugins
(go to "about:plugins" to see what is installed), or investigate <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1237/">QuickJava</a>, <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/433/">FlashBlock</a>, and
<a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>
if you really need them. Consider removing extensions that look up
more information about the websites you type in (like Google toolbar),
as they may bypass Tor and/or broadcast sensitive information. Some
people prefer using two browsers (one for Tor, one for unsafe browsing).
</li>

<li>Beware of cookies: if you ever browse without Tor and Privoxy
and a site gives you a cookie, that cookie could identify you even when
you start using Tor again. You should clear your cookies frequently. <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/82/">CookieCuller</a> can help
protect any cookies you do not want to lose.
</li>

<li>Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic,
and it encrypts everything inside the Tor network, but <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ExitEavesdroppers">it
can't encrypt your traffic between the Tor network and its final
destination.</a>
If you are communicating sensitive information, you should use as much
care as you would on the normal scary Internet &mdash; use SSL or other
end-to-end encryption and authentication.
</li>

<li>While Tor blocks attackers
on your local network from discovering or influencing your destination,
it opens new risks: malicious or misconfigured Tor exit nodes can send
you the wrong page, or even send you embedded Java applets disguised as
domains you trust.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Be smart and learn more. Understand what Tor does and does not offer.
This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your
help <a href="<page volunteer>#Documentation">identifying and documenting
all the issues</a>.

<h2>Development releases and source code</h2>

<p>
These development snapshots are released so you can help us test new
features and bugfixes. Even though they have a higher version number
than the stable versions listed above, there is a much higher chance
of serious reliability and security bugs in these downloads. Please be

Tor 0.1.2.16
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Aug-2007/msg00000.html">

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#Testing">Recent changes to development releases</a></h2>

<p>2007-10-12:
Tor 0.2.0.8-alpha
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2007/msg00123.html">fixes
a crash bug that's been bothering us since February 2007, lets
bridge authorities store a list of bridge descriptors they've seen,
gets v3 directory voting closer to working, starts caching v3 directory
consensus documents on directory mirrors, and fixes a variety of smaller
issues including some minor memory leaks</a>.
The Windows bundle also includes the new <a
href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/">development Torbutton
version 1.1.8</a>, which improves usability and compatibility over 1.1.7.
Windows users are encouraged to
back up their Firefox settings before upgrading.
</p>

<p>2007-09-21:
Tor 0.2.0.7-alpha
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Sep-2007/msg00361.html">makes
bridges work again, makes bridge authorities work for the first time,
fixes two huge performance flaws in hidden services, and fixes a variety
of minor issues</a>. The Windows bundle also includes the new <a
href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/">development Torbutton version

web behavior. Windows users are encouraged to back up their Firefox

a new Vidalia version in the Windows and OS X bundles. Vidalia 0.0.14
makes authentication required for the ControlPort in the default
configuration, which addresses important security risks.
In addition, this snapshot fixes major load balancing problems

mean-time-between-failure approach to tracking which servers are stable,
rather than just looking at the most recent uptime</a>.
</p>

<p>2007-08-19:
