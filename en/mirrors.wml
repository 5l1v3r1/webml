<h2>Tor: Mirrors</h2>
<hr />

<p>
The canonical URL of this site is <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a>,
but there are a few mirrors of it in other places.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to run a mirror, it's as easy as this command to download
everything a mirror should share with the world:
<br /> <br />
<tt>
rsync -av rsync://rsync.torproject.org/tor tor-mirror/
</tt>
<br/> <br/>
Please ensure that you keep your mirror updated (we suggest automating this
task with something like '<tt>cron</tt>'). Our website, source code and
binary releases change often. Tor users everywhere will thank you.
</p>

<p>
If you are running a mirror, please email
<a href="mailto:tor-webmaster@torproject.org">tor-webmaster@torproject.org</a>
and we'll add it to the list.
