<p>
Bridge relays (or "bridges" for short) are Tor relays that aren't listed in 
the main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if 
your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably 
won't be able to block all the bridges.
</p>

<p>
To use a bridge, you'll need to locate one. Furthermore, you'll need to 
configure Tor with whatever bridge address you intend to use.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, you can get a bridge by visiting 
<a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">https://bridges.torproject.org/</a> 
with your web browser.

<p>
As an example exercise, you'll get a bridge entry that looks like the 
following:<br>
<pre>
bridge 141.201.27.48:443 4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Understanding the above example isn't strictly required but may prove useful. 
You can skip this section if you'd like.
The first element is the name: <tt>'bridge'</tt>.<br>
The second element is the IP address: <tt>'141.201.27.48'</tt><br>
The third element is the port: <tt>'443'</tt><br>
The fourth element is the fingerprint: 
<tt>'4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413'</tt><br>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
To use the example bridge address above, go to Vidalia's Network settings 
page, and click "My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network". You'll want 
to add as many bridge addresses as you know about. Regardless of how many 
bridges you intend to use, the process for use is the same. Add each bridge 
address one at a time in the Vidalia Network settings page. One bridge should 
be enough for general use. However, in the event of using a single bridge, 
one bridge failing will cause loss of access to the Tor network. Adding 
additional bridges will increase reliability. This is pictured below:<br><br>

<h4><a class="anchor" href="#FindingMore">Finding more bridges with Tor</a></h4>
<hr />

<p>
Another way to find public bridge addresses is to send mail to 
bridges@torproject.org with the line "get bridges" by itself in the body of the 
mail. However, so we can make it harder for an attacker to learn lots of bridge 
addresses, you must send this request from a gmail or yahoo account.
