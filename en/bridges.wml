<p>
Bridge relays (or "bridges" for short) are Tor relays that aren't listed in
the main Tor directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if
your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably
won't be able to block all the bridges. If you suspect your access to the
Tor network is being blocked, you may want to use the bridge feature of Tor.
</p>

<p>
The addition of bridges to Tor is a step forward in the blocking
resistance race. It is perfectly possible that even if your ISP filters
the Internet, you do not require a bridge to use Tor. Many filtering
programs look for unencrypted Tor directory requests to recognize that
you're using Tor, but Tor version 0.2.0.23-rc and later use encrypted
directory queries by default. This change means that most filtering
programs are now unable to recognize Tor connections. So you should try
to use Tor without bridges first, since it might work.
</p>

<p>
Note that it's also possible that Tor is non-functional for other
reasons. The latest version of <a href="<page torbrowser/index>">The
Tor Browser Bundle</a> on Windows tries to give you better hints about
why Tor is having problems connecting. You should also read <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">the
FAQ about problems with running Tor properly</a> when you have issues.
If you feel that the issue is clearly blocking, or you'd simply like to try
because you're unsure or feeling adventurous, please read on. Ensure
that you're using the <a href="<page download>#Dev">latest 0.2.1.x or
0.2.2.x bundle for your platform</a>.
</p>

<p>
To use a bridge, you'll need to locate one. Furthermore, you'll need to
configure Tor with whatever bridge address you intend to use. You'll do this
with Vidalia, the Tor controller.
If your Internet connection requires the use of a proxy, you'll probably
need to configure Vidalia to do so first. If you don't think you need
to configure a proxy for your Internet connection, you probably don't.
Give it a try and if you have issues, ask us for help.

<p>Freedom House has produced a video on how to get and use Tor bridges.
You can view the video at <a
href="http://tinyvid.tv/show/3uiwckrlqynqv">TinyVid: Using Bridge Relays
to Access Tor</a>.  Know of a better video, or one translated into your
language?  Let us know!</p>

<p>
At the moment, you can get a bridge by visiting
<a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">https://bridges.torproject.org/</a>
with your web browser. If this page is filtered for you, and you
don't have any other proxies or ways to reach it, there are <a
href="#FindingMore">other ways to find bridges</a> too.
</p>

<a id="Understanding"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#Understanding">Understanding bridges</a></h2>

<p>
As an example, you'll get a bridge entry that looks like the
following:
</p>
<pre><samp>
bridge 141.201.27.48:443 4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413
</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Understanding the components of a bridge line isn't strictly required
but may prove useful. You can skip this section if you'd like.<br />
The first element is the IP address: <tt>'141.201.27.48'</tt><br />
The second element is the port: <tt>'443'</tt><br />
The third element, the fingerprint, is optional:
<tt>'4352e58420e68f5e40bf7c74faddccd9d1349413'</tt><br />
</p>

<a id="UsingBridges"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#UsingBridges">Using bridges with Tor and
Vidalia</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
To use the example bridge address above, go to Vidalia's Network settings
page, and click "My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network".  Add each
bridge address one at a time in the Vidalia Network settings page,
by pasting it into the "Add a Bridge" window and then clicking the "+"
sign. Adding a bridge is pictured below:
</p>

<br /><br />

<p>
You'll want to add as many bridge addresses as you know about, since
additional bridges will increase reliability. One bridge should be enough
to reach the Tor network, but if you only have one bridge and it goes
down, you will be cut off from the Tor network.
</p>

<a id="FindingMore"></a>

<p>
Another way to find public bridge addresses is to send mail to
bridges@torproject.org with the line "get bridges" by itself in the
body of the mail. You'll need to send this request from a gmail
account, though &mdash; otherwise we make it too easy for an attacker
to make a lot of email addresses and learn about all the bridges.
Almost instantly, you'll receive a reply that includes:
</p>
<pre>
Here are your bridge relays:

 bridge 60.16.182.53:9001 c9111bd74a710c0d25dda6b35e181f1aa7911133
 bridge 87.237.118.139:444 c18dde4804e8fcb48464341ca1375eb130453a39
 bridge 60.63.97.221:443 ab5c849ed5896d53052e43966ee9aba2ff92fb82

</pre>
<p>
Once you've received the email with bridge information, you can continue the Vidalia configuration steps outlined <a href="#UsingBridges">above</a>.

<hr />

<p>
If you want to help out and you can't run a <a href="<page
docs/tor-doc-relay>">normal Tor relay</a>, you should
run a bridge relay. You can configure it either way:
<ul>
<li> manually <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#torrc">edit
your torrc file</a> to be just these four lines:<br />
<pre><code>
SocksPort 0
ORPort 443
BridgeRelay 1
Exitpolicy reject *:*
</code></pre></li>
<li><a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">or using Vidalia</a>:<br />
<img src="$(IMGROOT)/vidalia-bridges-setup.png" alt="Vidalia's Sharing
settings page" /></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you get "Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:443: Permission denied" errors
on startup, you'll need to pick a higher ORPort (e.g. 8080) or do <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ServerForFirewalledClients">some
complex port forwarding</a>.
</p>

<p>
When configured as a bridge, your server will <b>not</b> appear in the public
Tor network.
</p>

<p>
Your bridge relay will automatically publish its address to the bridge
authority, which will give it out via https or email as above. You can
also tell a user about your bridge directly: if you're using Vidalia,
you can copy-and-paste the bridge address from the Settings window. If
you're on Linux or BSD, you can construct the bridge address manually
using the <a href="#Understanding">format above</a> (you can find the
fingerprint in your Tor log files or in <tt>/var/lib/tor/fingerprint</tt>
depending on your platform).
</p>

<p>
If you would like to learn more about our bridge
design from a technical standpoint, please read the <a
href="<gitblob>doc/spec/bridges-spec.txt">Tor bridges
specification</a>. If you're interested in running an unpublished bridge
or other non-standard uses, please do read the specification.
