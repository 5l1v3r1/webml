href="http://nlnet.nl/">NLnet Foundation</a>.  The first is to improve the performance
of hidden services.  The second is to make Tor work better for low bandwidth
clients.  The NLnet <a

has more details about the two projects.</li>

<li>13 May 2008: <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00048.html">Tor 0.2.0.26-rc</a>
replaces several V3 directory authority keys affected by a recent <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">Debian
OpenSSL bug</a>.  <strong>This is a security-critical release.</strong>
Everybody running any version in the 0.2.0.x series should upgrade, whether
they are running Debian or not.  Also, all servers running any version of Tor
whose keys were generated by Debian, Ubuntu, or any derived distribution may
have to replace their identity keys.  See our
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html">security
advisory</a> or the <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mean-tor-clients%3F">blog
follow-up</a> for full details.  As always, you can find Tor 0.2.0.26-rc on
the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download#Dev">downloads page</a>.</li>
<li>Mar 2008: <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-google-summer-code-2008!">Tor
Project is in Google Summer of Code 2008!</a></li>

<li>Feb 2008: The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/people#Board">Board
of Directors</a> welcomes <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isaac-mao-elected-one-our-new-directors">Isaac
Mao</a> to the board.  We thank Rebecca McKinnon for her support and
contributions to the project.</li>

<li>Feb 2008: Tor is happy to announce the <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org">official Tor blog</a>.</li>

<li>Jan 2008: <a href="<page download>">Tor 0.1.2.19</a> (the latest
stable release) fixes a huge memory leak on exit relays, makes the
default exit policy a little bit more conservative so it's safer to run an exit
relay on a home system, and fixes a variety of smaller issues. Please
upgrade.  Full <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2008/msg00000.html">release
notes</a> are available.</li>

<li>Oct 2007: <a href="<page download>">Tor 0.1.2.18</a> (the new stable
release) fixes many problems including crash bugs, problems with hidden
service introduction that were causing huge delays, and a big bug that
was causing some servers to disappear from the network status lists for
a few hours each day. We also modified the default Privoxy config files
in the bundles to avoid some security problems, so make sure to leave
"install Privoxy" checked when you upgrade. See the <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Oct-2007/msg00000.html">release
announcement</a> for more information.</li>

<li>Oct 2007: As many of you know, The Tor Project became an <a
href="<page people>">independent and official nonprofit</a> this past
February. We did this so we could accept grants from groups who
only donate to NGOs, and so our donors could deduct qualifying
<a href="<page donate>">donations</a> made to us.
<br />
We'd like to extend our profound thanks to the <a
href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> for their
past support, fiscal sponsorship, and help in hosting some of our web
pages, and for their continued mentorship of and counsel to our
fledgling nonprofit organization.</li>

<li>Sep 2007: If you have received email claiming to be Tor, it wasn't
from us. The <a href="<page download>">official Tor bundles</a> can be <a
href="<page verifying-signatures>">verified as authentic</a>.</li>

<li>Aug 2007: <strong>Please update your Tor software!</strong>  The
latest versions (stable: 0.1.2.17; development: 0.2.0.6-alpha)
patch a significant security vulnerability.  See the <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Aug-2007/msg00000.html">release
announcement</a> for more information.</li>

<li>Feb 2007: The Tor Project and UColo/Boulder <a
href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/anonymous/2007/02/26/the-rumors-of-our-demise/">respond</a>
to a recent blogstorm regarding a paper documenting a possible attack
strategy against Tor.</li>

<li>Jan 2007: The Tor network has grown to hundreds of thousands of
users. The developers can't do all the new features, bug fixes, and
documentation. <a href="<page volunteer>">We need your help!</a></li>

<li><b>We are actively looking for new sponsors and funding.</b>
If your organization has an interest in keeping the Tor network usable
and fast, please <a href="<page contact>">contact us</a>. Sponsors of Tor
also get personal attention, better support, publicity (if they want it),
and get to influence the direction of our research and development.
<a href="<page donate>">Please donate.</a></li>
