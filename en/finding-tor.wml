<h1>Tor: Finding Tor</h1>
<hr />
<p>
Sometimes it's not possible to directly reach the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project website</a>. We're currently
working on ways to help users find, download and install a current version of
Tor without already having Tor. We know that these suggestions are imperfect
but we hope that users will be able to find Tor indirectly if our website is
blocked. If you're reading this from a search engines cache, directly from our
website or by some other method, we hope these suggestions are helpful.
Additionally, if you have ideas for how to improve these instructions, please
<a href="<page contact>">contact us</a> and let us know.
</p>

<h2>Fetching Tor with Tor: Using your web browser</h2>
<hr />
<p>
If you're already running Tor, you're should be able to download a new Tor
securely with your current Tor. You should do this for your friends who don't
already have Tor. You can do this from our <a href="<page download>">download
page</a> or from a download page on one of the many Tor <a href="<page mirrors>">mirrors</a>.
Plese take care to  <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/VerifyingSignatures">verify
the signature</a> of any downloaded package when possible.
</p>

<h2>With a little help from our friends: Using Mirrors</h2>
<hr />
<p>
A Tor mirror is a site that contains an exact copy of our main site.
People who cannot reach the Tor website are encouraged to visit our <a
href="<page mirrors>">mirrors</a> to download copies of our source code as well
as binary builds for their specifically desired platforms. You may want to use
a search engine to find mirrors if our mirror page is blocked or seemingly
unresponsive. It is very imporant to <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/VerifyingSignatures">verify
the cryptographic signatures</a> of our software when using any mirror. We
cannot ensure the safety or security of any package hosted on remote mirrors
without a signature. It's probably safe but a cautious user should check
signatures if possible.
</p>

<h2>Fetching Tor via email: gettor</h2>
<hr />
<p>
It is possible to get a copy of Tor by sending an email to a special email
address: '<tt>gettor AT torproject.org</tt>'. This email system is a gateway
that allows anyone who can send email to get a copy of Tor. Currently, we only
support mail systems that we know
don't mind large email attachments. Gmail and Yahoo! mail are two such mail
services that are known to work. This is useful for users who can send email
but have no other direct method of downloading Tor. A user only needs to tell
us their Operating System (Windows XP? Mac OS X? Linux?). An email with the
requested package will be sent shortly.
