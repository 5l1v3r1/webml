<h1>Tor: Finding Tor</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Sometimes it's not possible to directly reach the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project website</a>. We're currently
working on ways to help users fetch a current version of Tor without already
having Tor.
</p>

<h2>Fetching Tor with Tor: Using your web browser</h2>
<hr />
<p>
If you're already running Tor, you're able to download Tor securely over
Tor. You should do this for your friends who don't already have Tor.
</p>

<h2>With a little help from our friends: Using Mirrors</h2>
<hr />
<p>
People who cannot reach the Tor website are encouraged to visit our <a href="<page mirrors">mirrors</a> to
download copies of our source code as well as binary builds for their
specifically desired platforms. It is very imporant to <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/VerifyingSignatures">verify
our cryptographic signatures</a> when using any mirror, we cannot ensure the
safety or security of any package hosted on remote mirrors without such a
signature.
</p>

<h2>Fetching Tor via email: gettor</h2>
<hr />
<p>
In the near future, we will provide an email gateway that will allow users on
specific mail systems to fetch a copy of Tor. This means that users will have
no obvious connection to the Tor Project when used in conjunction with our new
briding feature. This service is not yet finished, please watch this space for
updates.
