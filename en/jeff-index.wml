<h2>Tor: anonymity online</h2>
<hr />

<p>
Tor helps keep you anonymous on the Internet.  It transfers your
communications around a worldwide set of servers.  This masks your
destination and source locations.  This provides some protections from a
variety of attacks from a variety of people and organizations on the
Internet.  There are many reasons to use Tor. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You live in a country that restricts access to certain sites or services.
Tor hides where you go on the Internet from your ISP,
so you can access any Internet site.</li>
<li>You live in a repressive state that monitors the content of your communications.
Tor encrypts your data until it gets to an "exit node" that could be on another
continent, making it very difficult to monitor the content of Internet communications.
<li>You are an abuse victim who wishes to anonymously join a survivor discussion group.
Tor ensures that your chats and emails are not traceable to your computer.</li>
<li>You are a law enforcement officer or corporate user who needs to use email,
websites, or chat
without the recipients or server owners knowing who you are affiliated with.
Tor masks where you are coming from, making it very difficult
to figure out where you are coming from or who you are.</li>
<li>You simply want some privacy concerning where you go, what you view, and what you do
on the Internet. Tor hides your Internet use from your ISP, the servers and transit nodes,
and prevents monitoring by anyone trying to see who is doing what on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
We have a full page devoted to explaining exactly <a href="<page overview>">
what Tor does, why it is important, and how it works</a>.

<p>
To quickly start using Tor, we recommend the
<a href="<page download>">Vidalia bundle</a>
as the easiest to install and get working.
</p>

<p>
There are three pieces of fine print you need to know about:
First, Tor does not protect you if you do not use it correctly.
Make sure to follow the
<a href="<page documentation>">instructions for your platform</a>
carefully. Second, even if you install, configure and use Tor correctly,
there are still
<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RemainingAttacks">
potential attacks that could compromise Tor's ability to protect you</a>.
Third, Tor is beta software, which means that it isn't done yet, and may
contain serious bugs or design flaws that render it ineffective. You should
not rely on Tor if you really need strong anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Tor's security improves as its user base grows and
more people volunteer to
<a href="<page docs/tor-doc-server>">run a server</a>. It isn't
nearly as hard to set up as you might think, and can significantly
<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ServerAnonymity">
enhance your own personal security against some attacks</a>.
If you can't run a server for some reason,
we need funds to research attacks on the Tor network, improve performance, and develop
new features to make Tor more reliable, secure, and speedy.

<ul>
<li>Sep 2007: If you have received email claiming to be Tor, it wasn't
from us. The <a href="<page download>">official Tor bundles</a> can be <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/VerifyingSignatures">verified
as authentic</a>.</li>
<li>Aug 2007: <strong>Please update your Tor software!</strong>  The
latest versions (stable: 0.1.2.17; development: 0.2.0.6-alpha)
patch a significant security vulnerability.  See the <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Aug-2007/msg00000.html">release
announcement</a> for more information.</li>
<li><b>We are actively looking for new sponsors and funding.</b>
If your organization has an interest in keeping the Tor network usable
and fast, please <a href="<page contact>">contact us</a>. Sponsors of Tor
also get personal attention, better support, publicity (if they want it),
and get to influence the direction of our research and development.</li>
