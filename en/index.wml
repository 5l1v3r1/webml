<h2>Tor: anonymity online</h2>
<hr />

<p>Tor is a software project that helps you defend against <a
href="<page overview>">traffic analysis</a>, a form of network
surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential
business activities and relationships, and state security.
Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed
network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents
somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you
visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical
location.
Tor works with many of your
existing applications, including web browsers, instant messaging
clients, remote login, and other applications based on the 
TCP protocol.
</p>

<p> Hundreds of thousands of people around the world use Tor for a
wide variety of reasons: journalists and
bloggers, human rights workers, law enforcement officers, soldiers,
corporations, citizens of repressive regimes, and just ordinary
citizens.  See the <a href="<page torusers>">Who Uses Tor?</a> page for
examples of typical Tor users.
See the <a href="<page overview>">overview page</a> for a
more detailed explanation of what Tor does, why this diversity of
users is important, and how Tor works.
</p>

<p>
There are three pieces of fine print you need to know about.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Tor does not protect you if you do not use it correctly.
Read <a href="<page download>#Warning">our list of warnings</a> and
make sure to follow the
<a href="<page documentation>#RunningTor">instructions for your platform</a>
carefully.</li>
<li> Even if you configure and use Tor correctly, there are still
<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RemainingAttacks"
>
potential attacks that could compromise Tor's ability to protect
you</a>.</li>
<li>No anonymity system is perfect these days, and Tor is no exception:
you should not rely solely on the current Tor network if you really need
strong anonymity.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tor's security improves as its user
base grows and as more people volunteer to
<a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">run relays</a>. (It isn't
nearly as hard to set up as you might think, and can significantly
<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RelayAnonymity">
enhance your own security against some attacks</a>.)
If running a relay isn't for you, we need
<a href="<page volunteer>">help with many other aspects of the project</a>,
and we need funds to <a
href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Funding">continue
making the Tor network faster and easier to use while maintaining good
security</a>.

<li>Feb 2008: The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/people#Board">Board
of Directors</a> welcomes <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isaac-mao-elected-one-our-new-directors">Isaac
Mao</a> to the board.  We thank the Rebecca McKinnon for her support and
contributions to the project.  Tor is also happy to 
announce the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org">official Tor blog</a>.</li>
<li>Jan 2008: <a href="<page download>">Tor 0.1.2.19</a> (the latest
stable release) fixes a huge memory leak on exit relays, makes the
default exit policy a little bit more conservative so it's safer to run an exit
relay on a home system, and fixes a variety of smaller issues. Please
upgrade.  Full <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2008/msg00000.html">release
notes</a> are available.</li>
<li><b>We are actively looking for new sponsors and funding.</b>
If your organization has an interest in keeping the Tor network usable
and fast, please <a href="<page contact>">contact us</a>. Sponsors of Tor
also get personal attention, better support, publicity (if they want it),
and get to influence the direction of our research and development.
