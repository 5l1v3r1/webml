<h2>Tor: An anonymous Internet communication system</h2>

<br />
<p>
NEWS: <a href="<page index>#News">see News below for German server story</a>
</p>

<p>
Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want
to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help
you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH,
and other applications that use the TCP protocol. Tor also provides a
platform on which software developers can build new applications with
built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.
</p>

<p>
Tor aims to defend against <a href="<page overview>">traffic analysis</a>,
a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
anonymity and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships,
and state security.
Communications are bounced around a distributed network of servers called
onion routers, <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#WhatProtections">protecting you</a>
from websites that build profiles of your interests,
local eavesdroppers that read your data or learn what sites you visit,
and even the onion routers themselves.
</p>

<p>
Tor's security is improved as its user base grows and as
more people volunteer to run servers.  Please consider
<a href="<page volunteer>">volunteering your time</a> or
<a href="<page docs/tor-doc-server>">volunteering your
bandwidth</a>.
And remember that this is development code&mdash;it's not a good idea to rely
on the current Tor network if you really need strong anonymity.

<li>Sep 11 2006:
<p>
Last week, a few Tor exit nodes were seized by the German police in a
massive sting against child pornography.  From our friends on the ground in
Germany, we hear that dozens and dozens of other computers may have been
seized too.
</p>

<p>So far as we know, only six of those were Tor servers.  We have heard
from the server operators.  None of them has been charged.  We hope that
this is just a misunderstanding that can be solved by educating German
law enforcement about Tor.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is not a "crackdown" on Tor</b>, as has been widely reported.
This seems to be part of a wide sweep on computers associated by IP address
with a large child porn bust.  There does not seem to be any specific
targetting of Tor &mdash; Tor is used by journalists, human rights
activists, dissident bloggers, and a vast array of blameless users.
</p>

<p>
We hope that the volunteer Tor server operators in Germany will get their
equipment back after this has blown over, and there will be no action against
Tor.

<p>
If you are a Tor server operator in Germany, please contact <a

information.

</li>

<li>Feb 2006: The Tor network has grown to hundreds of thousands of
users. The developers can't do all the new features, bug fixes, and
documentation. <a href="<page volunteer>">We need your help!</a></li>

<li>Jan 2006: <b>We are now actively looking for new sponsors and funding.</b>
If your organization has an interest in keeping the Tor network usable
and fast, please <a href="<page contact>">contact us</a>. Sponsors of Tor
also get personal attention, better support, publicity (if they want it),
and get to influence the direction of our research and development.</li>
