<h2>Tor: anonymity online</h2>
<hr />

<p>
Tor covers your tracks on the web. When you connect to the Internet from
your computer, you leave a return address that's like a calling card,
everywhere you go. Even if you don't log into a site with a username and
password, you leave information on what IP address you came from and when.
</p>

<p>
Since this is all the information that is usually needed to find out
who was on the other end of the wire, marketers, governments, and other
curious parties can trace you by tracing the activity associated with
your IP address.
</p>

<p>
Tor hides your IP address. It's like blocking your caller ID.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of thousands of people around the world use Tor &mdash; <a
href="<page whousestor>">journalists and bloggers, human rights workers,
law enforcement officers, soldiers, corporations, citizens of repressive
regimes, and just ordinary citizens</a>. We have a full page devoted
to explaining exactly <a href="<page overview>">what Tor does, why this
diversity of users is important, and how Tor works</a>.
</p>

<p>
To quickly start using Tor, we recommend the
<a href="<page download>">Vidalia bundle</a>
as the easiest to install and get working.
</p>

<p>
There are three pieces of fine print you need to know about.
First, Tor does not protect you if you do not use it correctly.
Read <a href="<page download>#Warnings">our list of warnings</a> and
make sure to follow the
<a href="<page documentation>#RunningTor">instructions for your platform</a>
carefully. Second, even if you configure and use Tor correctly,
there are still
<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RemainingAttacks"
>
potential attacks that could compromise Tor's ability to protect you</a>.
Third, no anonymity system is perfect these days, and Tor is no exception:
you should not rely solely on the current Tor network if you really need
strong anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Tor works by bouncing your traffic around a set of relays run by
volunteers all around the world. Tor's security improves as its user
base grows and as more people volunteer to
<a href="<page docs/tor-doc-relay>">run a relay</a>. It isn't
nearly as hard to set up as you might think, and can significantly
<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ServerAnonymity">
enhance your own security against some attacks</a>.
If running a relay isn't for you, we need
<a href="<page volunteer>">help with many other aspects of the project</a>,
and we need funds to <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Funding">continue
making the Tor network faster and easier to use while maintaining good
security</a>.

<ul>
<li>Oct 2007: As many of you know, The Tor Project became an <a
href="<page people>">independent and official nonprofit</a> this past
February. We did this so we could accept grants from groups who
only donate to NGOs, and so our donors could deduct qualifying
<a href="<page donate>">donations</a> made to us.
<br />
We'd like to extend our profound thanks to the <a
href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> for their
past support, fiscal sponsorship, and help in hosting some of our web
pages, and for their continued mentorship of and counsel to our
fledgling nonprofit organization.</li>
<li>Sep 2007: If you have received email claiming to be Tor, it wasn't
from us. The <a href="<page download>">official Tor bundles</a> can be <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/VerifyingSignatures">verified
as authentic</a>.</li>
<li>Aug 2007: <strong>Please update your Tor software!</strong>  The
latest versions (stable: 0.1.2.17; development: 0.2.0.6-alpha)
patch a significant security vulnerability.  See the <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Aug-2007/msg00000.html">release
announcement</a> for more information.</li>
<li><b>We are actively looking for new sponsors and funding.</b>
If your organization has an interest in keeping the Tor network usable
and fast, please <a href="<page contact>">contact us</a>. Sponsors of Tor
also get personal attention, better support, publicity (if they want it),
and get to influence the direction of our research and development.</li>
</ul>
