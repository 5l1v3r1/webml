<h1>Tor: Translation Portal</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Effective use of Tor is made possible by an ecosystem of software.
Many different parts of this ecosystem need translation help: Our <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/">Translation Portal</a> will suit
most translators best.
In addition to the main Tor website and Tor documentation, there are currently
other projects in need of translation help. In order of importance they
are: Vidalia, TorButton and TorCheck. Please read the sections that interest
you and if you need help, please ask &mdash; we're always happy to lend a hand.

<p>
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/">The Tor Translation Portal</a> is
a system which lists all sentences in use in a particular project, and allows
interested volunteers to translate individual
sentences or phrases as they are able.
</p>

<p>
You can check the status of all translations for a given project by visiting
each project page.  The following statuses are updated in real time when new
translations are added:
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torbutton/">Torbutton</a>,
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torcheck/">TorCheck</a> and
of course <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/vidalia/">Vidalia</a>.
</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#TTPVidalia">Translating Vidalia with the Tor Translation Portal</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
Vidalia uses the <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/">The Tor
Translation Portal</a> to manage translations.
</p>

<p>
To get started using our translation website, you need to sign up for an
account. Visit the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/register.html">account registration
page</a> to get started. Be sure to enter a proper email address and a strong
password. After you fill in the form and use the 'Register Account' button, you
should see some text indicating that things worked out: 
<pre>
Account created. You will be emailed login details and an activation code.
Please enter your activation code on the activation page.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Shortly after you see this text an email will be sent to the email address you
provided. The email should look something like the following:
<pre>
A Pootle account has been created for you using this email address.
Your activation code is:
36074ec543c1fa23ceeaf8e187dfa43e
This message is sent to verify that the email address is in fact correct. If
you did not want to register an account, you may simply ignore the message.
Your user name is: example_user
Your password is: example_user
Your registered email address is: username@example.com
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Once you've received the email, you'll need to activate your account by
visiting the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/activate.html">activation page</a>.
Enter your username and activation code into the form and then submit the form
by pressing the "Activate Account" button.

You'll see a message that says:
<pre>
Redirecting to login Page...
Your account has been activated! Redirecting to login...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When you login to your new account, you'll be prompted to configure your basic
language preferences on the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/home/options.html">options page</a>. At
the very least, you'll want to select the user interface language, select any
of the projects you're interested in translating, and additionally the languages
you wish to translate. Save your changes by clicking the "Save Changes" button
when you're finished.
</p>

<p>
You're ready to translate!
</p>

<p>
At this point, you'll want to select a project, such as <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/vidalia/">Vidalia</a>. You'll
see a nice list of all of the currently supported languages along with the
current translation progress. Select a language, in our example, you'll click
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/">German</a>. The next
page should show you a single row of data for the file "<a
href='https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/vidalia.po?translate=1&view=1'>vidalia.po</a>".
This is the file with all of the currently translated German strings for
Vidalia. You'll want to click on the "<a
href='https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/index.html?editing=1'>Show
Editing Functions</a>" link above the 'vidalia.po' row. Next you'll want to
click the "<a
href='https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/translate.html?fuzzy=1&editing=1&blank=1'>Quick
Translate</a>" link. This will take you to the first untranslated string in the
language group for the current project.
</p>

<p>
If you're able, please translate the string you see and click the 'Submit'
button. If you're unsure, click the 'Suggest' button. Feel free to leave
comments for any of the translations if you feel it's important to clarify
anything.
</p>

<p>
When you're finished, you'll want to commit your changes by returning to the
page with the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/index.html?editing=1">Editing
Functions</a>. You'll want to click on the "<a
href='https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/index.html?editing=1&docommit=1&commitfile=vidalia.po'>Commit</a>"
link. This will commit your changes into the <a
href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/projects/vidalia/de/">Translation
subversion module</a> in the specific area as specified by your choices of
language and project (Vidalia and German, for this example).
</p>

<p>
For more advanced users who like to translate without a web browser, you can
also download the .po file directly. You'll find this option after clicking on
the "<a
href='https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/index.html?editing=1'>Show
Editing Functions</a>" link. You should see a link to download the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/de/vidalia/vidalia.po">PO file</a>. If
this option fits your working habits, by all means, please use it! When you're
finished translating the .po file, you can upload it by using the "upload file"
form in the upper right hand corner, simply select the file and click the
'Upload file' button. 
</p>

<p>
That's all there is to it!
</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingVidalia">Other Vidalia translation efforts</a>
</h2>
<hr />

<p>
If you're interested in more advanced translation efforts, you've found the
right place. It's best to start by reading the general Vidalia
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations">translation
overview page on the Vidalia wiki</a>.
</p>

<p>
Vidalia has three key areas in need of translation. The first area is the
Vidalia GUI itself. This area is covered by the Tor Translation Project. The
second area for translation is the Win32 installer, and then third is localized
help documentation.
</p>

<p>
<b>The main Vidalia program</b> (the GUI itself) needs to be translated.
Please visit the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/vidalia/">Tor Translation
Portal page for Vidalia</a>. If you're unsure how the portal works, please see
our <a href="<page translation-portal>#TTPVidalia">Vidalia walkthrough using
the Tor Translation Portal</a>.
</p>

<p>
For more advanced users, translation of Vidalia can be handled in subversion.
You're welcome to
<a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/translation/trunk/projects/vidalia/">check
the current translation files</a>, and find a locale that
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/vidalia/">
requires further translation</a> or
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#NewGUITranslation">
start a translation</a> that we don't have. If you do use check out with
subversion, please upload via the Tor Translation Portal web interface.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your choice between the two methods, you can translate with the
<a href="https://translation.torproject.org/">The Tor Translation Portal</a>
service and/or with files directly from subversion. The process isn't as
important as the final product, so you should use
the method that best suits your working style. We think that the Tor
Translation Portal will suit most users best.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Win32 installer</b> uses the NSI format and is found in the Vidalia subversion
repository. The NSI format is very similar to normal gettext templates.
The file format is quite simple. Essentially, it is text with the corresponding
translations. This is a good place to get your feet wet with localization and a
normal text editor. Currently this format is not supported by the translation
portal.  You'll only need a text editor and knowledge of two languages, English
and whatever locale you'll be translating the original English into.
You can download the NSI localization files from the Vidalia subversion
repository. For more information on translating the Win32
installer, please see the corresponding instructional
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#TranslateInstallers">
page on the Vidalia wiki</a>. It's a useful page that explains step by step
information for translation, encoding and submission for inclusion in the next
release. You'll also notice that the wiki page lists translators - we're
especially in need of Farsi and Hebrew translators. Perhaps you're the one?
</p>

<p>
Last but certainly not least, Vidalia requires diligent
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#AvailableHelpTranslations">
translation of its <b>help documents</b></a>. This is important to ensure that users
fully understand the choices that they make and so they understand
the choices the software makes on their behalf. We're currently looking
for German and Bulgarian translators; perhaps you're the right person for the job?
</p>

<a id="TranslatingTorbutton"></a>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingTorbutton">Translating Torbutton</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
<a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/">Torbutton</a>
is a Firefox extension that protects Firefox users from many different
threats. Since Torbutton is necessary to help protect users, we need
Torbutton to be translated into as many languages as possible.
</p>

<p>
Torbutton (like Vidalia and TorCheck) translation is managed by the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/">Tor Translation Portal</a>. You can
easily view the status of all translations on the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torbutton/">Portal status page
for Torbutton</a>. Torbutton is also <a
href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/projects/torbutton/">in
subversion</a> like Vidalia and TorCheck.  Please visit the Portal page for <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torbutton/">Torbutton</a> and
pick a locale to translate.  (You'll have to create an account and log in.)
</p>

<p>
If you're unsure about how to use the the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/">Tor Translation Portal</a> to
translate Torbutton, please read <a href="<page
translation-portal>#TTPVidalia">our example walkthrough with Vidalia</a>.
Torbutton uses the same system with the same processes.
</p>

<a id="TranslatingTorCheck"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingTorCheck">Translating TorCheck</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
TorCheck is the simplest and smallest of the bunch. TorCheck is a
website run by a simple python program. It allows Tor users to check if
they are using Tor properly. Since TorCheck is the first website that
some Tor users see, and its goal is to let them know if their browser
is set up correctly, it is useful to have this page available in many
languages. TorCheck is also the easiest to translate as it's a single
very small file with only a few strings.
</p>

<p>
TorCheck (like Viadlia and Torbutton) is managed by the  <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/">Tor Translation Portal</a>. Simply visit the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torcheck/">TorCheck
translation status page</a> to see what's in need of translation. Please just
jump in and start translating the missing messages. (You'll have to create an account and log in.)
</p>

<p>
If you're unsure about how to use the the <a
href="https://translation.torproject.org/">Tor Translation Portal</a> to
translate Torbutton, please read <a href="<page
translation-portal>#TTPVidalia">our example walkthrough with Vidalia</a>.
TorCheck uses the same system with the same processes.
</p>

<p>
If the locale
you wish to add support for isn't translated or doesn't exist, you can easily
start the translation. Simply download a copy of
<a
href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/projects/torcheck/templates/TorCheck.pot">the
gettext template from the subversion repository</a>, open it in your text
editor, and start translating.
When you're finished translating, you'll want to submit a patch via email
to the <tt>tor-translation</tt> team as listed on the
<a href="<page contact>">contact page</a>. Files should be encoded as UTF-8.

We've written some basic guidelines to help you translate
the Tor website and documentation on our <a href="<page translation>">main
translation page</a>. The guidelines there also provide good advice for
the other translation items on this page. The current status of the website
