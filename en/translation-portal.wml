<h1>Tor: Translation Portal</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Effective use of Tor is made possible by an ecosystem of software. 
It's important to the Tor project that we help facilitate translation of 
many different parts of this ecosystem.

Tor website and documentation</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
If you want to help translate the Tor website and documentation into
other languages. We've written some basic guidelines to help you do this as
efficiently as possible on our <a href="<page translation>">main translation 
page</a>. It would be useful to read those guidelines first and to consider 
the advice for further translation work.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the main Tor website and Tor documentation, there are currently 
other projects in need of translation help. In order of importance they 
are: Vidalia, TorButton and TorCheck. Please read the sections that interests
you and if you need help, please ask &mdash; we're always happy to lend a hand.

<a id="TranslatingVidalia"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingVidalia">Translating
Vidalia</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
Getting started with <a href="http://www.vidalia-project.net/">Vidalia</a> 
translations is easy. We're working on making it easier daily. 
</p>

<p>
It's best to start by reading the general Vidalia
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations">translation 
overview page on the Vidalia wiki</a>.
</p>

<p>
Vidalia has three key areas in need of translation. The first area is the 
Vidalia GUI itself, the second is the Win32 installer and then third is 
localized help documentation.
</p>

<p>
<b>The main Vidalia program</b> (the GUI itself) is in need of translation.
Vidalia now supports using LaunchPad for easy translation. LaunchPad offers 
a web service to aid with translation. You can easily
visit the <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/vidalia/trunk">
Vidalia LaunchPad translation page</a>. Just visit LaunchPad to get started.
You'll need an account on LaunchPad to use this service to the full extent 
possible. The step by step instructions are currently listed in the 
translations section of the
<a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/tor/trunk/doc/translations.txt">
translations.txt Tor documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
For more advanced users, translation of Vidalia can be handled with 
subversion. You're welcome to 
<a href="http://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/src/vidalia/i18n/">check 
the current translation files</a>, find a locale that 
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#UpdateGUITranslation">
requires further translation</a>, or
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#NewGUITranslation">
start a translation</a> that we don't have.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your choice between the two methods, you can translate with the 
LaunchPad service and/or with files directly from subversion.
The process isn't as important as the final product, you should use the method 
that best suits your working style.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Win32 installer</b> uses the NSI format and is found in the Vidalia subversion 
repository. The NSI format is very similar to normal gettext templates. 
The file format is quite simple. Essentially, it is text with the corresponding 
translations. This is a good place to get your feet wet with localization.
You'll only need a text editor and knowledge of two languages, English and 
whatever locale you'll be translating the original English into.
You can download the NSI localization files from the Vidalia subversion 
repository. For more information on translating the Win32 
installer, please see the corresponding instructional 
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#TranslateInstallers"> 
page on the Vidalia wiki</a>. It's a useful page that explains step by step 
information for translation, encoding and submission for inclusion in the next 
release. You'll also notice that the wiki page lists translators - we're 
especially in need of Farsi and Hebrew translators. Perhaps you're the one?
</p>

<p>
Last but certainly not least, Vidalia requires diligant 
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations#AvailableHelpTranslations">
translation of its <b>help documents</b></a>. This is important to ensure that users 
fully understand the choices that they make and so they understand 
the choices the software makes on their behalf. We're currently looking 
for German and Bulgarian translators, perhaps you're the right person for the job?
<p>

<a id="TranslatingTorbutton"></a>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingTorbutton">Translating Torbutton</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
<a href="http://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/">Torbutton</a>
is a very important piece of software for users that wish to use a 
graphical web browser. It protects users against many different threats. 
It's basically required for anyone using Firefox and Tor together. This is why 
it is very imporant to ensure that Torbutton is translated into as many 
languages as is possible.
</p>

<p>
Torbutton translation is managed in subversion like Vidalia. However, Torbutton 
does not use LaunchPad. The main translation website used by Torbutton is the 
<a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/">Babelzilla</a> project. You'll need to 
sign up for a Babelzilla account to use the website. It is possible to 
download the locale files for 
<a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/locale">
translation from subversion</a> and edit them by hand.
</p>

<p>It's also possible to easily 
<a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&Itemid=88&extension=3510&type=lang">
view the current status of all Torbutton translations</a> in Babelzilla.
In addition to the current status of all Torbutton translations, Babelzilla 
also offers <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=2340">
a discussion board</a> for participating translators.
</p>

<a id="TranslatingTorCheck"></a>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#TranslatingTorCheck">Translating TorCheck</a></h2>
<hr />

<p>
TorCheck is the simplest and smallest of the bunch. TorCheck is a very simple 
python program that Tor users can use to check if they are using Tor properly. 
It was written for people who wanted to ensure that their web browser is 
configured for Tor properly. It's important to translate because it directly 
tells users if they are using Tor properly. TorCheck is also the easiest to 
translate as it's a single very small file with only a few strings.
</p>

<p>
TorCheck uses subversion. It's best to check 
<a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/check/trunk/i18n/">the repository</a>
to see if the locale you wish to translate is already started. If the locale 
you wish to add support for isn't translated, you can easily start the 
translation. Simply download a copy of 
<a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/check/trunk/i18n/TorCheck.pot">the 
gettext template from the subversion repository</a> and start translating.
When you're finished translating, you'll want to submit a patch via email 
to the <tt>tor-translation</tt> team as listed on the 
<a href="<page contact>">contact page</a>. Files should be encoded as UTF-8.
