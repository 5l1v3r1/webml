<h2>Tor: an anonymous Internet communication system</h2>

<p>
The right to speak anonymously is <a
href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Anonymity/">protected by the First
Amendment</a> in the United States and is crucial for safety, privacy,
and free expression on the global Internet. People who need anonymity
online range from whistleblowers and political dissidents to people
giving tips to the police and kids who are exploring online.
</p>

<p>
Tor helps these people by allowing them to communicate anonymously on the
Internet. It can anonymize web browsing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH, and
more. Your identity is hidden because communications are bounced around
a distributed network of servers called <a href="howitworks.html">onion
routers</a> -- this system makes it hard for recipients, observers,
and even the onion routers themselves to track the source of the stream.
</p>

<p>
Tor development is now supported by a grant from
the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a>. The more people use Tor and volunteer to
run servers, the better this service will be. Please consider <a
href="cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc.html#installing">installing
it</a> and then <a
href="cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc.html#server">helping
out</a>. You can also <a href="documentation.html">learn more about Tor here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Remember that this is development code -- it's not a good idea to rely
on the current Tor network if you really need strong anonymity.
