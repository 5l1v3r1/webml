<h2>How to Submit an Entry</h2>

<p>Submissions for phase one (sketches) should come as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images in an html page. The images must be able to be viewed on an
ordinary browser, e.g. Firefox. (You can submit proprietary formats too,
but if you do then you need to also export them to something we can
all read.) Must be licensed under a <a href="legal.html">free license</a>.</li>
<li>A design document (txt, html, pdf, or ps) as described in the
<a href="categories.html">Submission Categories</a> section.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions for phase two (code) should come as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code, with appropriate makefiles or documentation explaining
how to build it. Must be licensed under a free/open source license, as
defined by <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">OSI</a>. See <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/ContestFAQ#DefineFree">this
FAQ entry</a> for clarification.</li>
<li>Compiled binaries or bytecodes for at least one platform of choice.</li>
<li>A design document (txt, html, pdf, or ps) providing an overview of
what major functions to look for and what functions were implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit your entry, make a web page with
all your materials on it, then add a line to <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/ContestEntries">The
GUI Competition Entries Wiki</a>. (If you don't have a web page of
your own to put your entry on, find a friend who does, or mail <a
href="mailto:tor-gui@freehaven.net">tor-gui@freehaven.net</a> and we'll
put it up on a temporary page.</p>

<p>If you put it up on your own site, you can continue to update and
modify it. Remember that submitting early means you can get feedback
from Tor users and make it into a better submission!</p>
