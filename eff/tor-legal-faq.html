<h1>Legal FAQ for Tor Server Operators</h1>

<p><strong>by <a href="http://www.eff.org/">The Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF)</a>. Last updated 23 Dec 2004.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This FAQ is for informational purposes only
and does not constitute legal advice.  EFF has not analyzed any
particular factual situation or laws in drafting this FAQ, but rather
has tried to give a general description of the legal issues surrounding
Tor for a general audience.  Different factual situations and different
legal jurisdictions will result in different answers.  Therefore, please
do not act on this information alone; instead seek a complete review of
your situation with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction
if you have any specific issues or questions.</p>

<h2>Has anyone ever been sued for running Tor?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Further, we believe that running a Tor node is
lawful under U.S. law.</p>


<h2>Should I use Tor, or encourage the use of Tor, for illegal purposes
such as spamming, harassment, distribution of child porn, or copyright
infringement?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Tor has been developed to be a tool for free
speech, privacy and human rights.  It is not a tool designed or intended
to be used to break the law, either by Tor users or Tor server
operators.</p>

<p>We further recommend that you not keep any potentially illegal files
on the same machine you use for Tor, nor use that machine for any
illegal purpose.  Although no Tor server has ever been seized or
subpoenaed, the future possibility cannot be ruled out and if that
happens, you will want your machine to be clean.</p>


<h2>Can EFF promise that I won&rsquo;t get in trouble for running a Tor
server?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> All new technologies create legal uncertainties,
and Tor is no different.  Presently, no court has ever considered any
case involving the Tor technology, and we therefore cannot guarantee
that you will never face any legal liability as a result of running a
Tor server.</p>


<h2>Will EFF represent me if I get in trouble for running a Tor
server?</h2>

<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> While EFF cannot promise legal representation
of all Tor server operators, it will assist server operators in
assessing the situation and will try to locate qualified legal counsel
when necessary.  Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing legal
representation or referrals should be directed to staff attorney Kevin
Bankston (US +1 (415) 436-9333 x 126) such inquiries will be kept
confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege. 
Note that although EFF cannot practice law outside of the U.S., it will
still try to assist non-U.S. server operators in finding local
representation.</p>


<h2>Should I contact the Tor developers when I have legal questions
about Tor or to inform them if I suspect Tor is being used for illegal
purposes?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Tor&rsquo;s core developers, Roger Dingledine
and Nick Mathewson, are available to answer technical questions, but
they are not lawyers and cannot give legal advice.  Nor do they have any
ability to prevent illegal activity that may occur through Tor servers. 
Furthermore, your communications with Tor&rsquo;s core developers are
not protected by any legal privilege, so law enforcement or civil
litigants could subpoena and obtain any information you give to
them.</p>


<h2>If I receive a request from law enforcement or anyone else for my
Tor server&rsquo;s logs, what should I do?</h2>

<p><strong>Educate them about Tor.</strong> In most instances, properly
configured Tor servers will have no useful data for inquiring parties,
and you should feel free to educate them on this point.  To the extent
you do maintain logs, however, you should not disclose them to any third
party without first consulting a lawyer.  In the U.S., such a disclosure
may violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and server
operators outside of the U.S. may be subject to similar data protection
laws.</p>

<p>You may receive legal inquiries where you are prohibited by law from
telling anyone about the request.  We believe that, at least in the
U.S., such gag orders do not prevent you from talking to a lawyer,
including calling a lawyer to find representation.  Inquiries to EFF for
the purpose of securing legal representation should be directed to staff
attorney Kevin Bankston ((US +1 (415) 436-9333 x126). Such inquiries
will be kept confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client
privilege.</p>

<p>EFF is currently working on informational materials to help you
respond to the most likely types of legal requests or notices, so watch
this space.</p>


<h2>Should I snoop on the plaintext that exits through my Tor 
server?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> You are technically capable of monitoring or
logging plaintext that exits your node, if you modify the Tor source
code or install additional software to enable such snooping.  However,
Tor server operators in the U.S. can create legal and possibly even
criminal liability for themselves under state or federal wiretap laws if
they affirmatively monitor, log, or disclose Tor users&rsquo;
communications, while non-U.S. operators may be subject to similar laws. 
Do not examine the contents of anyone&rsquo;s communications without
first talking to a lawyer.</p>


<h2>Do Tor&rsquo;s core developers make any promises about the
trustworthiness or reliability of Tor servers that are listed in their
directory?</h2>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Although the developers attempt to verify that
Tor servers listed in the directory the core developers maintain are
stable and have adequate bandwidth, neither they nor EFF can guarantee
the personal trustworthiness or reliability of the individuals who run
those servers.  Tor&rsquo;s core developers further reserve the right to
refuse a Tor server operator&rsquo;s request to be listed in their
directory or to remove any server from their directory for any
reason.</p>


<h2>Is the Tor software subject to any license terms?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> The Tor license is included in the software
download and reproduced below:</p>
