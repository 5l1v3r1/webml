<h2>Tor: Contribute</h2>
<hr />

<p>Users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try Tor out, and let the Tor developers know about bugs you find or
features you don't find.</li>
<li>Please consider <a
href="cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc.html#server">running a
server</a> to help with development and scalability.</li>
<li>Does somebody want to help maintain this website, or help with
documentation, or help with managing our TODO and handling bug reports?</li>
<li>It would be nice to translate the documentation and other web pages
into other languages. (E.g. <a href="http://tor.freesuperhost.com/">Persian</a>)</li>
<li>Please fix up <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ">the FAQ Wiki</a>,
and if you know the answer to a question in the "unanswered FAQs" list,
please answer it.</li>
<li>What else needs to be documented? What is mis-documented?</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>Graphics folks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a Tor logo.</li>
<li>We need a snazzy diagram or two, akin to the one BitTorrent has in
its <a href="http://bittorrent.com/introduction.html">introduction</a>,
to show people how Tor works.</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>People with sysadmin skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can somebody take a look at Martin's <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/SquidProxy">Squid
and Tor</a> page, and update it to reflect Tor's new <a href="">RedirectExit</a>
config option?</li>
<li>Right now the hidden service descriptors are being stored on the
dirservers, but any reliable distributed storage system would do (for
example, a DHT that allows authenticated updates). Can somebody figure
out our best options and decide if they're good enough?</li>
<li>How hard is it to patch bind or a DNS proxy to redirect requests
to Tor via our tor-resolve socks extension? What about to convert UDP
DNS requests to TCP requests and send them through Tor?</li>
</ul>

<p>Designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tor provides anonymous connections, but if you want to keep multiple
pseudonyms in practice (say, in case you frequently go to two websites
and if anybody knew about both of them they would conclude it's you),
we don't support that well yet. We should find a good approach and
interface for handling pseudonymous profiles in Tor. See <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2004/msg00086.html">this
post</a> and <a
href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2005/msg00007.html">followup</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>Developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need somebody to code up a GUI or other
controller program, to do configuration, etc. See our <a
href="cvs/tor/doc/control-spec.txt">control specification</a> for details,
and the <a href="cvs/tor/contrib/TorControl.py">rudimentary demonstration
Python control script</a>. No, we don't know what the interface should look
like.  You can use any license you want, but we'd recommend modified BSD or
maybe GPL; and we can only help out if your license conforms to the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">DFSG</a>.
</li>
<li>We especially need people with Windows programming skills
     to run an exit server on Windows, to help us debug.</li>
<li>We're always looking for better Windows installers.  Specifically,
   it would be great if somebody were to extend our NSIS-based windows
   installer to include FreeCap and Privoxy.</li>
<li>Does somebody want to do up a patch so we can be an NT service? Or
so we can go in the system tray?</li>
<li>A good (portable, fast, clean, BSD-free) asynchronous DNS library
would be really handy, so we don't have to keep forking DNS worker
threads to do gethostbyname.</li>
<li>See the <a href="cvs/tor/doc/TODO">TODO</a> and
<a href="cvs/tor/doc/HACKING">HACKING</a> files in the Tor distribution
for more ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Donors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go take a look at the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic
Frontier Foundation</a>. More EFF donations means more Tor development.</li>
