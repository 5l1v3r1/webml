"TorDNSEL is an active testing, DNS-based list of Tor exit nodes. Since Tor "
"supports exit policies, a network service's Tor exit list is a function of "
"its IP address and port. Unlike with traditional DNSxLs, services need to "
"provide that information in their queries."

"Previous DNSELs scraped Tor's network directory for exit node IP addresses, "
"but this method fails to list nodes that don't advertise their exit address "
"in the directory. TorDNSEL actively tests through these nodes to provide a "
"more accurate list."
