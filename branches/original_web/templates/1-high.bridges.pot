"Bridge relays (or \"bridges\" for short) are Tor relays that aren't listed "
"in the main Tor directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, "
"even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they "
"probably won't be able to block all the bridges. If you suspect your access "
"to the Tor network is being blocked, you may want to use the bridge feature "
"of Tor."

"The addition of bridges to Tor is a step forward in the blocking resistance "
"race. It is perfectly possible that even if your ISP filters the Internet, "
"you do not require a bridge to use Tor. Many filtering programs look for "
"unencrypted Tor directory requests to recognize that you're using Tor, but "
"Tor version 0.2.0.23-rc and later use encrypted directory queries by "
"default. This change means that most filtering programs are now unable to "
"recognize Tor connections. So you should try to use Tor without bridges "
"first, since it might work."

"To use a bridge, you'll need to locate one. Furthermore, you'll need to "
"configure Tor with whatever bridge address you intend to use. You'll do this "
"with Vidalia, the Tor controller.  If your Internet connection requires the "
"use of a proxy, you'll probably need to configure Vidalia to do so first. If "
