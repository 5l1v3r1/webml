"Tor's tools and technologies are already used by hundreds of thousands of "
"people to protect their activities online.  These users include journalists "
"and human rights workers in politically rigid countries communicating with "
"whistleblowers and dissidents.  Law enforcement officers on Internet sting "
"operations stay anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post socially "
"sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors and those "
"with illnesses.  The Tor network also provides protection for people looking "
"for another layer of privacy from the millions of websites and ISPs bent on "
"collecting private information and tracking their moves online."

"While Tor's original goal was to provide this important anonymity, many "
"people around the world use Tor to get around Internet censorship, as well. "
" <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://"
"globalvoicesonline.org/\">Global Voices Online</a> have both recommended Tor "
"as a tool to circumvent censorship regimes in oppressive nations. The "
"roadmap is focused on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the "
"advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies."

"\"If your Internet provider can't see what sites you're looking at, that "
"also means they can't prevent you from reaching sites they don't want you to "
"see,\" said Roger Dingledine, Tor Project Leader.  \"This new roadmap with "
"support from the larger community will let us make Tor even better at "
"fighting censorship.  With three years of funding, we can tackle larger "
"problems than before, and we can focus on making sure that Tor can grow to "
"handle all the people who want to use it.\""

"Based in Dedham, MA, The Tor Project develops free and open-source software "
"that provides online anonymity to the everyday Internet user. Tor was born "
"out of a collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research Lab starting in 2001, "
"and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2006. The Tor Project "
"now works with many individuals, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and "
"businesses globally to help them protect their anonymity online."

"In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor anonymity "
"software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also helps to lead the "
"research community in understanding how to build and measure scalable and "
"secure anonymity networks. The Tor developers publish several new research "
"papers each year in major academic security conferences, and just about "
"every major security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper."
