"<strong>DEDHAM, MA</strong> -The Tor Project has <a href=\"/press/"
"presskit/2009-03-11-performance.pdf\">launched a roadmap</a> for "
"dramatically improving the performance of the public Tor network over the "
"next year.  A combination of existing funding and a needed $1 million over "
"the next 12 months will ensure success.  This campaign is a direct result of "
"the recently published <a href=\"<page press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-"
"release>\">3-Year Development Roadmap</a>.  The roadmap incorporates "
"research and actions from a number of sources which define the next steps "
"for improving performance of the public Tor network.  The most requested "
"feature by users of the public Tor network is to increase performance while "
"keeping strong anonymity intact."

"As Tor's user base has grown, the performance of the Tor network has "
"suffered.  Over the past few years, Tor's funding (and thus the development "
"effort) has focused on usability and blocking-resistance.  We've come up "
"with a portable self-contained Windows bundle; deployed tools to handle the "
"upcoming censorship arms race; further developed supporting applications "
"like Vidalia, Torbutton, and Thandy; made it easier for users to be relays "
"by adding better rate limiting and an easy graphical interface with uPnP "
"support; developed an effective translation and localization team and "
"infrastructure; and spread understanding of Tor in a safe word-of-mouth way "
"that stayed mostly under the radar of censors.  All of these successess have "
"contributed to the growing user base and increased stress on the public Tor "
"network."

"Tor's tools and technologies are already used by hundreds of thousands of "
"people to protect their activities online.  These users include journalists "
"and human rights workers in politically rigid countries communicating with "
"whistleblowers and dissidents.  Law enforcement officers on Internet sting "
"operations stay anonymous with Tor, as do people wanting to post socially "
"sensitive information in chat rooms, like rape or abuse survivors and those "
"with illnesses. Â The Tor network also provides protection for people looking "
"for another layer of privacy from the millions of websites and ISPs bent on "
"collecting private information and tracking their moves online."

"are enough to get the items on the roadmap started, an additional $1 million "

"Tor network."

"Based in Dedham, MA, The Tor Project develops free and open-source software "
"that provides online anonymity to the everyday Internet user. Tor was born "
"out of a collaboration with the U.S. Naval Research Lab starting in 2001, "
"and it became an official U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit in 2006. The Tor Project "
"now works with many individuals, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and "
"businesses globally to help them protect their anonymity online."

"In addition to its efforts developing and maintaining the Tor anonymity "
"software and the Tor network, The Tor Project also helps to lead the "
"research community in understanding how to build and measure scalable and "
"secure anonymity networks. The Tor developers publish several new research "
"papers each year in major academic security conferences, and just about "
"every major security conference these days includes a Tor-related paper.  "
"Tor is a project-funded organization with eight full-time staff."
