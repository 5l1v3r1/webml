"Javascript can do things like wait until you have disabled Tor before trying "
"to contact its source site, thus revealing your IP address. As such, "
"Torbutton must disable Javascript, Meta-Refresh tags, and certain CSS "
"behavior when Tor state changes from the state that was used to load a given "
"page. These features are re-enabled when Torbutton goes back into the state "
"that was used to load the page, but in some cases (particularly with "
"Javascript and CSS) it is sometimes not possible to fully recover from the "
"resulting errors, and the page is broken. Unfortunately, the only thing you "
"can do (and still remain safe from having your IP address leak) is to reload "
"the page when you toggle Tor, or just ensure you do all your work in a page "
"before switching tor state."

"Due to <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409737"
"\">Firefox Bug 409737</a>, pages can still open popups and perform "
"Javascript redirects and history access after Tor has been toggled. These "
"popups and redirects can be blocked, but unfortunately they are "
"indistinguishable from normal user interactions with the page (such as "
"clicking on links, opening them in new tabs/windows, or using the history "
"buttons), and so those are blocked as a side effect. Once that Firefox bug "
"is fixed, this degree of isolation will become optional (for people who do "
"not want to accidentally click on links and give away information via "
"referrers). A workaround is to right click on the link, and open it in a new "
"tab or window. The tab or window won't load automatically, but you can hit "
"enter in the URL bar, and it will begin loading. Hitting enter in the URL "
"bar will also reload the page without clicking the reload button."

"Torbutton used to support basic proxy switching on Thunderbird back in the "

"Firefox support only, so I don't know why they didn't delete that "

"completely separate Thunderbird profile for your Tor accounts and use that "
"instead of trying to toggle proxy settings. But if you really like to roll "

"ProxyButton, SwitchProxy or FoxyProxy (if any of those happen to support "

"While FoxyProxy is a nice idea in theory, in practice it is impossible to "
"configure securely for Tor usage without Torbutton. Like all vanilla third "
"party proxy plugins, the main risks are <a href=\"http://www.metasploit.com/"
"research/projects/decloak/\">plugin leakage</a> and <a href=\"http://ha."
"ckers.org/weird/CSS-history.cgi\">history disclosure</a>, followed closely "
"by cookie theft by exit nodes and tracking by adservers (see the <a href="
"\"design/index.html#adversary\">Torbutton Adversary Model</a> for more "
"information). However, with Torbutton installed in tandem and always "
"enabled, it is possible to configure FoxyProxy securely (though it is "
"tricky). Since FoxyProxy's 'Patterns' mode only applies to specific urls, "
"and not to an entire tab, setting FoxyProxy to only send specific sites "
"through Tor will still allow adservers (whose hosts don't match your "
"filters) to learn your real IP. Worse, when sites use offsite logging "
"services such as Google Analytics, you will still end up in their logs with "
"your real IP. Malicious exit nodes can also cooperate with sites to inject "
"images into pages that bypass your filters.  Setting FoxyProxy to only send "
"certain URLs via Non-Tor is much more secure in this regard, but be very "
"careful with the filters you allow. For example, something as simple as "
"allowing *google* to go via Non-Tor will still cause you to end up in all "
"the logs of all websites that use Google Analytics! See <a href=\"http://"
"foxyproxy.mozdev.org/faq.html#privacy-01\">this question</a> on the "
